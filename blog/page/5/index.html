		<p>So it&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve posted anything.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy.</p>

<p>Between my new 9-5, an amazing girlfriend, the weather improving, several web projects and a few novels, my plate&rsquo;s been plenty full.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not gotten any new projects lately, but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of small(ish) changes/fixes to those I&rsquo;ve already got going.  I&rsquo;ve been considering having some kind of changelog for all my stuff in general, mostly to keep track of what I&rsquo;m doing on a day-to-day basis.  I&rsquo;ve started documenting such work but have yet to figure out a good place to share that with the rest of the world (or if that&rsquo;s even necessary).  I mean,<em> I</em> know I&rsquo;m doing the work, I just think it would be nice to let others know as well.</p>

<p>On that note, here&rsquo;s some general stuff I&rsquo;ve been working on since we last talked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added some stuff to lucy-dog.com, mostly aesthetic:

<ul>
<li>Changed title(s), metadata</li>
<li>Added a few new pictures</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting, paging issues with &lsquo;show all&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broken Spoke Updates:

<ul>
<li>Migrated existing site to new host</li>
<li>Added Events functionality to DB, front-end, admin panel</li>
<li>Added, tweaked some .js libraries for picking dates and times (related to Events)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all I can think of off the top of my head. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I get an actual changelog documented.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reminded this last week that GoDaddy is a real pain if you don&rsquo;t want to use their GUIs for everything.  Allowing SSH access took around 2 days to finally get implemented, after the DNS settings were populated.  I have yet to figure out how to use mysql from a shell; no combination of usernames and passwords allows me access, although those same credentials work everywhere else.  I&rsquo;m sure PHPMyAdmin is a fine tool if you like that sort of thing, but I really just want access to a mysql prompt.  Is that so much to ask, GoDaddy?</p>

<p>On a related rant I have yet to find a good emacs script for multi-mode editing (PHP, javascript, html, css in this example). I tried a few but they weren&rsquo;t really what I was looking for.  From what I remember (this was a few weeks back) one was very close, but its PHP-mode was all kinds of broken, to the point of unusability.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.</p>

<p>Almost done with the bike site, with the notable exception of graphics.  I am <em>absolutely</em> not a graphic designer, much as it pains me to admit.  I&rsquo;ve taken on a few projects now where they&rsquo;ve handed me a logo designed by someone for use as a sticker or on a t-shirt.  That&rsquo;s great, but my Adobe fu isn&rsquo;t such that I can easily make that into a pretty, well-laid-out header graphic.  Consequently graphics are what need the most improvement on these sites.  I&rsquo;m getting better with Photoshop and Illustrator every day, but at this point I&rsquo;d never take on a &lsquo;design&rsquo; project.  I truly appreciate nice graphics, and know what does and does not work or look good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I&rsquo;m not a graphic designer.  I write code.  It&rsquo;s one of those things where I think, &lsquo;With some experience you can make some awesome logos!&rsquo; and keep that in the back of my mind as I fumble with these design tools to produce graphics that don&rsquo;t quite cut it.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll eventually get there.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll just hire a graphic designer.</p>

<p>On a less technical note, I finished Infinite Jest a few weeks ago.  Initially I was upset by the ending (if one wants to call it that), but after a day or two of subconscious processing I came to the opposite conclusion: that while certain elements of the story were not explicitly explained, there were plenty of clues and allusions to allow the reader to work things out for himself.  I liked that.  Apparently DFW&rsquo;s last unfinished novel is out now, so I&rsquo;m going to have to pick that up soon.</p>

<p>At Devin&rsquo;s Mad Clojure Meetup last week I was referred to Logicomix, which I shortly thereafter bought and consumed.  The idea and format were what drew me immediately in:  a story about famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, in graphic novel format?  What&rsquo;s not to like about that?  While the illustrations were amazing, I found the writing a little boring and sometimes awkwardly/ambiguously phrased.  While I understand that including in-depth details of the fields would have made the book inaccessible to a good majority of readers, that&rsquo;s honestly what I was expecting and was a bit disappointed in that regard.  I felt that the book was too vague to be useful as anything more than a character-driven story and general history lesson.  Maybe that&rsquo;s what they were going for; I just imagined that they would cater to the &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; audience a bit more.</p>

<p>Still looking for a job in Milwaukee.  Further updates as events warrant.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I last posted.  Quite a bit&rsquo;s happened in that time.</p>

<p>To begin, I finally found a job.  Starting Wednesday I&rsquo;ll be working a regular 9-to-5, doing primarily technical support for pharmacy software.  While it&rsquo;s only a temporary position and doesn&rsquo;t involve much development, I&rsquo;m still really looking forward to some structure and a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; circadian rhythm.  I consider myself one of those people that loves to work, and get genuine satisfaction from doing a job well.  Also, it&rsquo;s well-paying and I&rsquo;m dead broke; that certainly doesn&rsquo;t hamper my anticipation.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done any Project Euler since I reached Level 2.  I felt it was a good stopping point for the time being, but I&rsquo;ve definitely learned a lot from it and plan on doing a problem or two when the urge strikes; perhaps in a new language.  It&rsquo;s been really good for learning syntax and structure basics for Python, and at this point I feel confident that I could pretty easily solve most problems with it.  If you&rsquo;re looking to learn a new language, applications (in the literal sense) to math problems are in my opinion a great way to start.</p>

<p>Still working on a couple of web development contracts, both for starting businesses.  They&rsquo;re going well, although the biggest problem I&rsquo;m having is with the level of detail to which I&rsquo;m giving these sites.  I&rsquo;m trying to keep things quick and simple, but jQuery and PHP make doing all these awesome things so simple that I end up spending wayyy too much time experimenting with features the client neither asked for nor particularly needs.  Giving them more than they asked for up-front isn&rsquo;t really a problem in itself (deleting is pretty simple), but it&rsquo;s becoming one given that these need to get finished post-haste since time will be sparse come tomorrow.</p>

<p>Finally, I launched a site last week called (tentatively): <a href="http://lucy-dog.com">Lucy In Hats</a>.  It started out as a joking comment about my girlfriend&rsquo;s dog, and within a few hours I had bought a domain name and had something up and running.  I&rsquo;ve been making tweaks and adding features since then, but the concept&rsquo;s been the same since the start: people vote on pictures of an adorable mini-pug in silly hats.</p>

<p>I ended up going through with the idea because I wanted to see how much traffic I could generate to the site, under the general knowledge that people can&rsquo;t get enough of cute animals.  That and learning the underlying technologies needed for a relatively simple site like this were my main goals for the project. The fact I only had to spend $10 on a domain name got things off the ground right away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done some &lsquo;advertising&rsquo; on Facebook, both on my account and on the lady&rsquo;s; beyond that I&rsquo;ve been relying on word-of-mouth and people&rsquo;s attraction to cuteness.  I&rsquo;d say he site is a success even at this point, at least as compared to ry-land.com and this blog.</p>

<p>As of right now I&rsquo;ve had around 10x as many unique visitors to the site as to ry-land.com, and about 35x as many page views.  Granted, I haven&rsquo;t advertised ry-land.com on Facebook, nor is there dynamic content to drive all those page views, but I&rsquo;m still pretty impressed by its popularity in the first week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really cranking out the jQuery and PHP and doing new stuff with them every day.  I&rsquo;m enjoying it, learning a bunch, and tomorrow I should even start making some money again.  Not bad.</p>

		<p>Spent the day attempting contact with people who didn&rsquo;t want to communicate with me.  Filed my state taxes (had done federal a week or so ago).</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t decide whether to feel good about today&rsquo;s productivity or not, so to add some weight to the &lsquo;productive&rsquo; side, I went ahead and finished the remaining 7 PE problems needed to get me to the coveted <strong>Level 2</strong>.</p>

<p>In case you were wondering, and for posterity,  those problems were: <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=33">33</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=53">53</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=41">41</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=56">56</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=97">97</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=55">55</a>, and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=79">79</a>.  Problem 79 was by far the most interesting; I even ended up doing some OOP with Python for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Quick summary:</strong></p>

<p>33: Was only getting three of the four fractions initially due my incorrectly assuming that the pre-canceled denominator was going to be a whole multiple of the numerator: 26/65 did not fit that mold.</p>

<p>53: The only issue here was parsing the actual problem syntax.  Thanks again, Professor Ono (my combinatorics prof.)</p>

<p>41: Although I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it before, I wrote a Sieve of Eratosthenes-like function for (really) quickly computing primes up to a certain number when I first started PE.  I once again used that here, and filtered that list down to pandigitals.  I won&rsquo;t say the answer, but I do want to mention the fact that it was 7-digits, due to the fact that the sums from 1 to 8 and 9 are 36 and 45, respectively, and so are always divisible by 3 (thanks to that nice rule for divisibility by 3).</p>

<p>56: Pretty much exactly how you&rsquo;d first think to do it.</p>

<p>97:  Ended up using Python&rsquo;s built-in pow() function, taking full advantage of its optional modulo argument to limit the result (and calculations) to only those last ten digits.  Other than that, completely straightforward.</p>

<p>55: Easier to just show this one.  Used a recursive function and the limits the explicitly stated.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2019414.js?file=euler_55.py'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>def lychrel(n, it):
    if it&lt;50:
        rev = n[::-1]
        _sum = str(int(n) + int(rev))
        if _sum==_sum[::-1]:
            return int(_sum)
        else: return lychrel(_sum, it+1)
    else: return 0

l = [x for x in range(1,10000) if not lychrel(str(x),0)]
print len(l)</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Problem 79 was the most interesting.  I just finished.  I made two related assumptions, without which my answer probably wouldn&rsquo;t work. I also cheated a bit and ended up explicitly telling the program which numbers were used in the password, although I could&rsquo;ve easily made that list from the input as well.</p>

<p>I ended up using a Python class in the same way you&rsquo;d use a C struct, in this case to associate two sets to each digit used in the password: one representing all the numbers that appeared to the left of that digit in those logins, and the other representing those that appeared to the right of it.  Here&rsquo;s where those assumptions I mentioned earlier came in:  I assumed that each digit was only present in the password once, and that there were no conflicting orderings (e.g. 6 appearing both to the left and right of a digit x in different login attempts, which would imply that x appears more than once in the password).</p>

<p>I ran my program and took a look at the lists, and saw that in this case my assumptions were correct.  Then I simply ordered those digits based on the lengths of their &lsquo;left&rsquo; sets (So the digit with nothing to the left of it would be first, and the digit with everything else to the left of it would be last.  Get it?).  Voila.  Code:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2019414.js?file=euler_79.py'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>class digit:
    def __init__(self,x):
        self.dig = x
        self.left = set()
        self.right = set()

#split the input into a list of 3-digit login attempts
logins = list(set([l.strip('\n\r') for l in open('keylog.txt')]))

#compile key's left and right sets
def place(key):
    num = str(key.dig)
    check = [line for line in logins if num in line]
    for line in check: #for each line that contains this digit
        place = line.index(num)
        for i in line:
            if line.index(i) &lt; place:
                key.left.add(i)
            elif line.index(i) &gt;place:
                key.right.add(i)

#create an instance for each digit present
obs = [digit(l) for l in ['0','1','2','3','6','7','8','9']]
#create those instances' associated sets
[place(dig) for dig in obs]

#place in logical order
obs.sort(key=lambda x: x.left)


'''
SORT V0
for i in range(9):
    for dig in obs:
        if len(dig.left)==i:
            print dig.dig
SORT V1
print [dig.dig for i in range(9) for dig in obs if len(dig.left)==i]
'''
print ''.join([d.dig for d in obs])
print reduce(lambda x,y: x+y,[d.dig for d in obs])</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Commented out near the bottom you&rsquo;ll see two previous methods I had used to do the final sorting mentioned above.  V0 had nested loops, which wasn&rsquo;t awful but not good; V1 was essentially just a list comprehension of same.  I tried to be a bit more &lsquo;pythonic&rsquo; with my final method, using lambda function within the list.sort() method to order the list of &lsquo;digit&rsquo; instances on their left set.</p>

<p>The last two lines produce the same string, but I wanted to show both approaches. The first is the preferred, pythonic, and much faster way.  The second is essentially the same as calling <code>print reduce(operator.add, [d.dig for d in obs])</code>.</p>

<p>which is exactly what Python&rsquo;s built-in <code>sum()</code> function does.   However Python will (purposely) throw an exception if you try to use <code>sum()</code> on a list of strings, apparently because they don&rsquo;t want you doing that (although, as I showed, lambdas are a way around that).</p>

<p>A more thorough explanation of the above can be found on Stack Overflow (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3525359/python-sum-why-not-strings">link</a>).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s official. I really like Python.</p>

		<p>Haven&rsquo;t written in a while.  Things have been busy.  Not always productive, but always busy.  I just finished a few PE problems, and I&rsquo;ll talk about those in a bit, but first here&rsquo;s everything else:</p>

<p>Officially started work on a new web development project, using mostly MySQL, JavaScript and PHP.  This will definitely be the most complicated of the ones I&rsquo;ve done so far, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning how to use these technologies to do things I&rsquo;ve done in the past with .NET.  I&rsquo;ll keep you posted on that.</p>

<p>The site&rsquo;s in an awkward in-between phase right now;  I stripped down a lot of stuff in my towards-2.0 efforts, but haven&rsquo;t added much new stuff besides some sweet fonts (props to @font-face).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling lately with my genetic predisposition toward a veritable smorgasbord of allergies and their physical manifestations (thanks mom and dad!), trying to keep things under control with medication and allergen-avoidance, the latter of which unfortunately includes my girlfriend&rsquo;s house.  So that&rsquo;s no fun.  Things are getting much better though and I for one cannot wait for this cold, dry weather to end.</p>

<p>For the aforementioned and other reasons, I haven&rsquo;t been doing a lot of going out.  Went to the Comedy Club last week for the 2nd round of the competition, but this week opted instead to see Say Hi at the High Noon Saloon, which was a good time.  Other than that it&rsquo;s been interviews, doctor&rsquo;s appointments, endless email correspondence, coding and reading.</p>

<p>I started Infinite Jest a few weeks ago and I&rsquo;m a little more than 1/3 done right now.  Despite the fact that a friend owns a copy and lent it out to me, I (after much internal debate) opted to buy the electronic version for my Kindle, which I don&rsquo;t regret.  Besides being able to jump to one of the hundreds of endnotes by simply clicking on the text-embedded link (as opposed to flipping rather awkwardly back and forth through a ragged, floppy paperback version), I&rsquo;m also able to see the definition of a word (e.g. &lsquo;atavistic&rsquo;) simply by hovering over it.  I&rsquo;m really enjoying both the book itself and its positive impact on my vocabulary.</p>

<p>Regarding the job front, all&rsquo;s (mostly) quiet.  It&rsquo;s still an awkward situation, between looking for temporary/contract/short-term work in Madison v. a development &lsquo;career&rsquo; in Milwaukee.  Even the contract jobs I&rsquo;m finding here are confusingly looking for someone with the desire to work (the contract position) full-time.  While I haven&rsquo;t been dishonest at interviews to any degree regarding my long-term goals and career plans, I know that doing so would probably get me the position (a few places have even stated this implicitly).  In a manner consistent with my vocational luck as of late, I&rsquo;ve now been presented with one verifiable and one probable job offer, for long-term development positions here in Madison.  Again, though, I don&rsquo;t want to lie my way into a job when I know very well I&rsquo;ll be gone in August, so for the time being unemployed I remain.</p>

<p>Project Euler.  I&rsquo;ve now got 43 problems done.  7 more and I&rsquo;ll be level 2 and finished with the first page.  Regarding the last post I managed to speed up problem 27 and knocked that one down.  Tonight I completed <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=31">31</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=37">37</a> and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=39">39</a>, but I&rsquo;m mostly gonna be explaining and (<em>gasp</em>) presenting my solution to problem 39.</p>

<p>I had actually started on problem 37 a week or so ago, but my solution wasn&rsquo;t finding all 11 requested primes in the range of like [1, 100,000,000].  I was on the right track with realizations like &lsquo;these primes can&rsquo;t contain the digits 4,6, or 8 anywhere,&rsquo; I went wrong in also including 2 and 5 in that list, since those numbers could in fact be the leftmost digit of said primes.  P37 done.</p>

<p>Problem 31 was mostly a no-brainer; I&rsquo;ve seen similar problems in Combinatorics and wrote a recursive algorithm to solve it.  It essentially involved moving from the highest-denomination coins to the lowest, with the recursive function calculating in how many ways the given amount could be made with a decreasing number of denominations.  P31 done.</p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=39">Problem 39</a> asks you to find the perimeter <em>p</em> of a right triangle that has the greatest number of possible pythagorean triples (a,b,c) that can satisfy that perimeter.  After some half-written solutions and great deliberation, the solution came out of knowing that term, &lsquo;pythagorean triple,&rsquo; and consequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple">this Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>Reading through this, particularly the parts about <strong>P</strong>rimitive <strong>P</strong>ythagorean <strong>T</strong>riples and Euclid&rsquo;s formula, I was able to engineer a solution through the following logic:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> All possible Pythagorean triples (what we&rsquo;re trying to tally for our solution) are either a PPT or a multiple of same.</p></li>
<li><p> PPTs can be calculated with Euclid&rsquo;s formula: <code>a = m^2 - n^2, b = 2mn, c = m^2 + n^2</code> given that <code>m &gt; n</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are coprime (i.e. <code>gcd(m,n)==1</code>), and one of them is even.</p></li>
<li><p> Combining the formula above with the Pythagorean Theorem and the obvious fact that <code>a + b + c = p</code>, we get: <code>2m^2 + 2mn = p</code></p></li>
<li><p> For a triple to be a solution for a perimeter <em>p</em>, <em>p</em> must be a multiple of a given PPT&rsquo;s perimeter.  Put another way, for (a,b,c) of a satisfying PPT, <code>p % (a + b + c) == 0</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>After that it was just a matter of putting it all together:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2019433.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>from fractions import gcd

#Euclid's Formula
def getabc(m,n):
    a = m**2 - n**2
    b = 2*m*n
    c = m**2 + n**2
    return a,b,c

#calculate all PPTs for which p &lt; 1000
prim_trips = [getabc(m,n) for m in range(1,100) for n in range(1,100) if m &gt; n and gcd(m,n) == 1 and 2*m*m + 2*m*n &lt;= 1000 and (m%2 == 0 or n % 2 == 0)]

#find all possible triples for a given p
def total(p):
    return sum([1 for (a,b,c) in prim_trips if p % (a + b + c) == 0])

#collect all possible solutions for each perimeter p
totals = [(p,total(p)) for p in range(1,1001)]

#get max
print max(totals, key = lambda x: x[1] )
</code></pre></noscript></div>

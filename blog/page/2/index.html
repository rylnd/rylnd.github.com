		<p>I was recently trying to deploy a heroku instance for some testing. I hadn&rsquo;t done any work on heroku in a while, and ended up getting stuck on a credentials issue.</p>

<p>While I had successfully done a <code>$ gem install heroku &amp;&amp; heroku create --stack cedar</code>, I got the following error when trying to do a <code>$ git push heroku master</code> to get things up and running:</p>

<pre><code>!  Your key with fingerprint 09:84:27:65:48:de:b4:48:fe:64:25:d8:dd:55:d8:db
is not authorized to access evening-snow-7878.

fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm.  That looked like an ssh issue to me. A quick <code>$ ssh-keygen -l</code> of a few of my keys told me that it was using the &lsquo;wrong one,&rsquo; which was my default ssh key.</p>

<p>Looking at <code>$ heroku keys</code> didn&rsquo;t help; it was using the correct key. So the issue was with my ssh config, not the heroku gem or its configuration.</p>

<p>I quickly tried to add an entry to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file, along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>Host heroku.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/the_key_you_want
</code></pre>

<p>But I still got the same error: it was still using the wrong key. I did some quick googling and couldn&rsquo;t find a good answer.  I eventually stumbled on this <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-accounts">excellent heroku plugin</a> that does exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<p>However, if you aren&rsquo;t using many accounts, and don&rsquo;t want to type a command in each terminal session, here&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s doing under the covers (and what I ended up doing):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add something like the following to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>Host heroku.app_name
  HostName heroku.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/the_key_you_want
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add a remote to your repo using that host:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add heroku git@heroku.app_name:app_name.git
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>That should be it. Enjoy!</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t posted anything in a while. I won&rsquo;t make excuses, that&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, the blog is no longer WordPress, nor is it hosted on my Linode. A few weeks ago, during <a href="http://bendyworks.com">bendyworks</a>&lsquo; amazing growth days (which will be described in a future post), I converted my blog entries to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>-formatted YAML and markdown. This was actually the hardest part of the process. I won&rsquo;t go into details, but it involved piping my WordPress-exported posts through a Rube-Goldbergesque series of Python libraries.</p>

<p>With my old posts converted, I then got an <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> repository set up on GitHub, using their super-cool <a href="http://pages.github.com">Pages</a> functionality for hosting and super-easy deployment. The whole process is very slick, and requires much, much less effort, maintenance, money, and disk space than my former methods.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be tweaking the look and content in the weeks to come; I just wanted to give an update (mostly so that my newest post wasn&rsquo;t a year old).</p>

		<p>Hoo boy.  A lot has changed in the past few weeks.  After spending about a month looking for jobs and apartments in Milwaukee, we finally found both.  We found the perfect apartment, and I accepted a job offer for an awesome Django startup in Spreenkler&rsquo;s Accelerator program.  The day after I said yes to the job, I was approached with an offer here in Madison.  While both were amazing jobs, I ended up taking the job here in Madison as I felt it had more to offer, experientially.  Starting at the end of August, I&rsquo;ll be an official <a href="http://bendyworks.com/">Bendyworker</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this means that the time Amanda and I spent planning for Milwaukee was basically for naught.  I&rsquo;ve got an amazing job, but we&rsquo;re back to square one apartment-wise.  I&rsquo;ve moved every year since 2005; I&rsquo;m ready to buy a house out of sheer laziness.</p>

<p>Speaking of laziness, I&rsquo;ve been working day and night on our startup, <a href="http://jungolhq.com">Jungol</a>.  We just launched our alpha tonight, after much internal tinkering.  I&rsquo;ve read time and again that the best thing you can do is just put your project out there, so it&rsquo;s something of a relief to finally have done so.  Check it out at <a href="http://jng.li/qJ338J">http://jng.li/qJ338J</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of smaller things that still need to be done, but most everything&rsquo;s there right now.  We&rsquo;ve got our proof of concept; the rest is up to the public (who told us they wanted this, we swear).  It&rsquo;s an exciting time and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of the whole thing.  Having written the entire site save for design, it&rsquo;s becoming like a child to me, but I&rsquo;m trying my best not to become too emotionally attached.</p>

<p>Our final frisbee game is next Tuesday.   Our <em>championship</em> frisbee game, that is.  This last week was playoffs, and we won both games.  I&rsquo;m pretty proud of the team; we had a lot of beginners, some who&rsquo;d never even played a team sport before, but we&rsquo;ve come together and are playing amazingly well.  Playing with the same team every year is comforting, I&rsquo;m sure, but there&rsquo;s something to be said for this amazing transition from &lsquo;group of people&rsquo; to &lsquo;team&rsquo; over the course of a season.  Remind me to let you know if we won or not.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a great job and a great girlfriend.  Let me know if you see any great apartments for rent around town.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hoo boy.  A lot has changed in the past few weeks.  After spending about a month looking for jobs and apartments in Milwaukee, we finally found both.  We found the perfect apartment, and I accepted a job offer for an awesome Django startup in Spreenkler&#8217;s Accelerator program.  The day after I said yes to the job, I was approached with an offer here in Madison.  While both were amazing jobs, I ended up taking the job here in Madison as I felt it had more to offer, experientially.  Starting at the end of August, I&#8217;ll be an official <a href="http://bendyworks.com/">Bendyworker</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this means that the time Amanda and I spent planning for Milwaukee was basically for naught.  I&#8217;ve got an amazing job, but we&#8217;re back to square one apartment-wise.  I&#8217;ve moved every year since 2005; I&#8217;m ready to buy a house out of sheer laziness.</p>

<p>Speaking of laziness, I&#8217;ve been working day and night on our startup, <a href="http://jungolhq.com">Jungol</a>.  We just launched our alpha tonight, after much internal tinkering.  I&#8217;ve read time and again that the best thing you can do is just put your project out there, so it&#8217;s something of a relief to finally have done so.  Check it out at <a href="http://jng.li/qJ338J">http://jng.li/qJ338J</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of smaller things that still need to be done, but most everything&#8217;s there right now.  We&#8217;ve got our proof of concept; the rest is up to the public (who told us they wanted this, we swear).  It&#8217;s an exciting time and I&#8217;m proud to be a part of the whole thing.  Having written the entire site save for design, it&#8217;s becoming like a child to me, but I&#8217;m trying my best not to become too emotionally attached.</p>

<p>Our final frisbee game is next Tuesday.   Our <em>championship</em> frisbee game, that is.  This last week was playoffs, and we won both games.  I&#8217;m pretty proud of the team; we had a lot of beginners, some who&#8217;d never even played a team sport before, but we&#8217;ve come together and are playing amazingly well.  Playing with the same team every year is comforting, I&#8217;m sure, but there&#8217;s something to be said for this amazing transition from &#8216;group of people&#8217; to &#8216;team&#8217; over the course of a season.  Remind me to let you know if we won or not.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve got a great job and a great girlfriend.  Let me know if you see any great apartments for rent around town.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh, hey there!  It&#8217;s been so long I almost didn&#8217;t recognize you!  Yeah, I&#8217;ve been good.  Real busy with work, if you can call it &#8216;work.&#8217;  Busy regardless, though.</p>

<p>The Jungol project has been going great.   I don&#8217;t think I can overemphasize how refreshing it is.  The team, the framework, the project itself, and the freedom that I&#8217;m given are amazing.  Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m not grateful.</p>

<p>We had a bit of an uphill climb at first, make no mistake.  We needed to take the original idea, gather a whole lot of customer feedback, and decide what was most likely to succeed given those inputs.  This brings to mind an excellent quote I saw on Twitter the other day:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Entrepreneurship is like jumping off a cliff and assembling your airplane on the way down&#8221;
&#8211; Reid Hoffman</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve got the plane&#8217;s body and most of its engine done.  Now we get to start her up and start adding paint and decals.  I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>Ditching the metaphor and returning to reality, the lady and I will be heading to Milwaukee tomorrow to look at apartments.  It&#8217;s going to be a welcome break from all the time spent staring at a terminal screen, but the overachiever in me is constantly nagging to &#8216;get back to work.&#8217;  We might stay and go to Summerfest on Sunday, depending on how my Ego feels.</p>

<p>We attended our first Concert on the Square on Wednesday, which was graciously hosted by the folks at The Firm.  They have a balcony overlooking the capitol, and were even nice enough to fill their office with food, beer, developers, entrepreneurs, and investors!  It was a fun time, to say the least.</p>

<p>Frisbee has had its ups and downs; some games we dominate, others we barely avoid a forfeit due to lack of players.  We&#8217;re not the best in the league, but we&#8217;re certainly not the worst.  Win or lose, though, we still get two free pitchers after every game. :)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really know what else to say right now.  Things are up in the air, and the future is uncertain, but I&#8217;m having a blast and learning every day.   I am happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything, but I&#8217;ve been really, really busy.  Most importantly:  I <strong>quit my job to work for a startup</strong>.</p>

<p>I was approached by Steve at Spreenkler about two weeks ago.  He asked if I&#8217;d be interested in working as a developer for one of the teams in their summer <a href="http://spreenklertalentlabs.org/startup/?page_id=4">Incubator Program</a>.  My old job was incredibly understanding about the opportunity, and after a few meetings and a trip to Milwaukee I was part of Jungol, Inc.  Expect a more detailed post about the team and what I&#8217;m doing (hint: I&#8217;m <em>the</em> developer) in the near future, when I have some more time.</p>

<p>Started doing some <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> problems.  I thought &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m getting it!&#8221; until I enabled Golf Mode and saw how my problems (at least length-wise) compared to others&#8217; on the site.  Rest assured that I&#8217;m working on it; I&#8217;ve got the first 25 problems done so far.</p>

<p>I added a header to the site.  Not sure if I really like it, but it adds color and I didn&#8217;t cringe upon seeing it the next day (stepping away from it for a while is always a good choice), so it&#8217;s here to stay.  I&#8217;ll be making small changes here and there, dependent on time and interest.</p>

<p>Frisbee is going good; we&#8217;re 2-1 and we finally got our sweet jerseys.
It&#8217;s been quite an ordeal trying to find an organize a team (yes, even for a &#8216;sport&#8217; like Ultimate Frisbee), but I&#8217;m pretty damn happy with the results.  I&#8217;ve been trying to organize everything on Google (Mail, Documents, Calendar) and while I created the tools for my team to use, I certainly can&#8217;t force their utilization.  Oh, well.  At least people are showing up to games (and winning them).</p>

<p>Amanda and I went to the <a href="http://www.clipsoffaith.com/">Clips of Faith</a> Tour at Olin Park on Friday, and that was a blast.  Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really good beer, relatively cheap</li>
<li>Free handlebars upon entry</li>
<li>Entry to win the New Belgium cruiser</li>
<li>Delicious vegan nachos</li>
<li>Really cool short films</li>
</ul>


<p>Lastly, I&#8217;ve finally taken the leap and bought a MacBook Pro.  While I&#8217;ve supported OS X in previous jobs I&#8217;ve never actually owned or used it.  I&#8217;m mostly using the terminal for development anyways, so work-wise it&#8217;s not that big of a jump from linux.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m also <strong>moving from Emacs to vim</strong>, which is a more considerable jump.  I&#8217;d used vim previously in college, but have done most of my serious programming with Emacs in the last year or two.  That&#8217;s going much better than I would have expected, though.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for any significant plugins right now but I&#8217;m going to be using vim from now on and see how it goes.</p>

<p>The reason for vim?  Why, my third and final paradigm shift:  I&#8217;m using Ruby on Rails as the framework for this startup project.  I spent last week learning as much as I could while getting my new workstation set up, and spent Saturday at Bendyworks for the Ruby Hack Day Meetup.  Everyone was super nice and helpful as usual; the only thing keeping me from learning more was my reluctance to speak up and ask for help.  I got a basic rails project up, and will be getting some actual guts in there this week.  The only thing I&#8217;m missing is a testing framework (I&#8217;m going to be using rspec, if any, but it&#8217;s not in there yet).  I&#8217;m currently debating whether unit testing would be reasonable at this point, given the already steep learning curve I&#8217;m facing.  I&#8217;m probably going to hold off for the first few basic features, and maybe reassess the situation in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Ruby/Rails hurdle is going to be a huge one, as I&#8217;m quickly learning, but I&#8217;m really excited to have this opportunity.  As a consequence I&#8217;ve been doing more hacking than sleeping, and it&#8217;s really starting to catch up with me.  It&#8217;s an absolute blast, and in my mind it&#8217;s not work at all, but my body is beginning to disagree with me.</p>

<p>On that note, I think it&#8217;s time I rest my weary head a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I&#8217;m really tired but I wanted to make note of a few updates.  While I&#8217;m not naive enough to think that the built-in comment system is the reason the blog doesn&#8217;t have any comments, I realize that that could conceivably be an issue if the site actually had readers.  With that in mind, I present the new comment system, powered by <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>!</p>

<p>I finally got around to updating Wordpress this week as well.  I don&#8217;t have FTP on my server for several reasons (mainly security), so Wordpress&#8217; handy dandy auto-install isn&#8217;t an option for me (I suppose I could temporarily use it, but that&#8217;s almost as much work as just doing it manually).  It&#8217;s pretty painless since most of the files they update aren&#8217;t ones I&#8217;ve customized, but I always delay it because I fear change (and they update so damn often).</p>

<p>Made some minor style tweaks as well, probably nothing you&#8217;ll notice.  $1 to anyone that does.</p>

<p>Next week should be pretty exciting (or at least blogworthy), so stay tuned for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh snap.  Lots of exciting stuff happening lately.  Most publicly, I finally got some old code up on <a href="https://github.com/ryalnd">GitHub</a> a week or so ago.  &#8216;Social Coding&#8217; is such an amazingly cool concept, I deeply regret not participating sooner.  I literally get giddy when I load my dashboard.  It&#8217;s probably love.  Follow me or just lurk; I&#8217;ll be posting some more projects in the near future, and probably talking about it here.</p>

<p>In an exciting new development, Spreenkler has apparently changed their minds about the whole Zappos Gift Certificate thing (thanks to a rogue email by Devin, of which I swear I had no knowledge).  We&#8217;ve yet to receive the goods, but Steve @ <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a> apparently talked to the guys at Blurbs and they agreed that we could have the award.  I was dumbfounded by the kindness exhibited in that gesture; if Steve and co. are representative of the Milwaukee community, I cannot wait.</p>

<p>Going along with that, I may have been offered an amazing opportunity for the summer that could really help kick-start things for me.  I&#8217;ll give more details when things are more definite, but in the meantime I hope you&#8217;re as excited as I am.</p>

<p>In other news, I finally checked my site out in IE today and it was HORRIBLE.  I&#8217;m more generally of the stance &#8216;F*** IE users&#8217; but the overwhelming numbers and my inability to ignore a problem once it&#8217;s noticed led me to fix things up.</p>

<p>I have so much stuff I want to read, code, and watch.  There aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day. &#8216;night for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First: I started this post on Monday, but never got around to finishing it.</p>

<p>Went to the Mad Railers meetup Monday, despite my body requesting otherwise.  I figure if I don&#8217;t have the time to sit down and learn Ruby right myself right now, I should at least take advantage of these local groups.</p>

<p>The topic was testing, and while that might not be where most people would start when learning a new language (myself included), I have no doubts that it will help me in the long run.  There were a few great talks and I learned quite a bit.  I&#8217;m slowly putting the framework together in my mind, piece by piece.</p>

<p>My general approach to learning practical programming has been &#8216;abstraction is a treat that must be deserved.&#8217;  While higher-level languages are amazing and I absolutely cannot wait to use them professionally, at the same time I feel like I need to program a little &#8216;lower&#8217; for a while to appreciate and understand things to a reasonable degree.  Subsequently a good deal of what I do has holes and certainly isn&#8217;t as comprehensive as if I&#8217;d put the same amount of work on top of a template.  But finding and plugging those holes is a great learning experience.</p>

<p>Running my own VPS and web server has probably been the best project, education-wise.  There are certainly plenty of holes and configurations that go into system administration stuff, along with being great practice with bash.  I didn&#8217;t really get that when I was a student, but I&#8217;m sure glad I&#8217;m doing it now.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case this wasn&#8217;t apparent, I wanted to make it explicit real quickly:  all the blog posts thus far have been written on the fly.  I&#8217;ve not gone back and edited them in any major (or minor, for that matter) way;  I believe my stream-of-consciousness is coherent enough to follow without doing so, and I&#8217;m not trying to win any Pulitzers here anyway.</p>

<p>That being said, if something is unclear or obviously, distractingly wrong in one of my posts, please feel free to let me know and I&#8217;ll definitely look into making it clearer/correct.</p>

<p>I realize also that this disclaimer will likely only be read by me, so it&#8217;s probably more of a note to myself to be more conscious of those kinds of things while writing than an actual disclaimer to my (allegedly extant) readership.</p>

<p>Apparently the word of the day is &#8216;extant.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran into a former coworker at Noodles last week, and when I mentioned I was moving to Milwaukee and looking for a job, he suggested I take a look at <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a>, a startup incubator based in Milwaukee.  I did some research and found that they were putting on a 24-hour hackathon over the weekend!  Realizing that this event combined three things I desperately needed: hacking experience, job opportunities (or at least some MKE networking), and free food, I decided I simply couldn&#8217;t pass it up.</p>

<p>This all happened on Thursday evening, with the event starting Saturday at noon. Sure it was short notice, but all coding was to be done on-site, right?  All we needed by Saturday was an idea.  While I had managed to convince a couple friends (Jared and Devin) to join my &#8216;team&#8217; on Friday evening, we still didn&#8217;t have an idea.  There was some mention of the Zappos API, but the team&#8217;s general indolence brought us to our final idea:  winging it.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, 12:00pm:</strong>  I felt a bit nervous walking in, as I&#8217;d never done any public coding before. All the more reason to start now though, right?  People slowly trickled in.  12:30pm: Time to announce our plans to everyone.  Uh oh.  We&#8217;d forgot about that.  We figured a plan would slowly form as we tinkered with the tools we were given; actually presenting that was going to be embarrassing, as everyone else seemed to have a solid game plan.  But we did.  Something along the lines of &#8216;We&#8217;re going to use the Zappos API.  That is all.&#8217;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, we had a team name and a git repo (Devin), both named Hot Biscuits (don&#8217;t ask me).  An encryption bug on my laptop prevented me from authenticating with github until I finally figured out a workaround; speed bump #1.</p>

<p>We tinkered with the API for a bit, and while the documentation didn&#8217;t exactly match what the API was sending us, we were able to figure it out pretty quick.  Jared got Apache running, Devin set up the DNS (and bought a new domain name, for funsies), and I got the initial databases up and running.  Not a bad start.</p>

<p>With a general structure in place, the next step was to start polling the API and storing the results.  Perl was suggested, as were ruby, clojure, and python.  I said I&#8217;d do this part, in python (due to previous experience), and set to work.  Jared took off for a bit to run some errands, and Devin, left waiting on my work, started writing the API->DB in clojure, being the fanboy that he is.</p>

<p>The script wasn&#8217;t as clean as I would have liked, because despite having a nice list of dicts to work with, I still had to quote the text being stored, and format the dates to appease the MySQL gods.  After a little bit, though, I had what looked like the correct sequence of SQL statements printing to stdout.  I changed the prints to executes, ran the script, and got &#8230; a whole bunch of encoding errors.  The problem involved some Unicode characters being sent back, and I figured I just had to specify UTF-8 as the encoding type and move right along.  Nope.  Not knowing about the default collation in MySQL, I suspected that might be the problem.  Nope.  Devin was still chugging away on his clojure implementation, and Jared, errands run, ended up writing a solution in perl that actually worked (eventually).  So by the afternoon we had three (mostly) working scripts that did exactly the same thing.  Efficiency!</p>

<p>With data now coming in, we realized the API made no guarantee about duplicates, so we made a few changes to uniques in the DB to prevent that from happening.  Confident that we could now slap a few data-visualization APIs on top of what we had and call it an MVP, we decided to break for dinner/loved ones.</p>

<p>We ended up meeting later that night for a bit to discuss the next morning&#8217;s game plan.  We mocked up a page layout, and planned on meeting back at the hackathon at 8:30 the next day (3 hours is plenty of time to do an entire front-end, right?). I also whipped up a craptacular logo before bed.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday Morning:</strong>  I reluctantly woke up a little before 8.  I was excited to work on the front-end, sure, but there are few things I value more than sleep (probably because I get so little of it during the work week).  Arrived at the building, and was immediately thwarted by locked doors; claims that the building would open again at 8am overlooked the fact that the building was officially closed on Sundays. I didn&#8217;t have the number for the room the event was using, but one of the coordinators fortuitously came down a few minutes later to let someone else in.  Phew.</p>

<p>I figured (correctly) that my teammates would be late, so set to work on writing an HTML skeleton and a basic stylesheet.  Tinkered for a little bit with color schemes and <a href="http://www.patternify.com/">Patternify</a>, an awesome CSS pattern generator that gives you the tile image&#8217;s base64 encoding, so you don&#8217;t even need a separate image file (pretty sweet, right? I even used it for the blog&#8217;s current bg).</p>

<p>Once my teammates showed up, the next few hours were a frantic, stressed blur.  We had location data, and we had brand data.  Someone whispered &#8220;Crocs.&#8221;  There it was: use our data to display statistics about Crocs purchases from Zappos.com.  A guaranteed winner; a tool everyone needed (they just didn&#8217;t know it yet).</p>

<p>The night before, I&#8217;d found a Google Charts API that could color a map.  It promised it could do so given a value for each region, and a &#8216;color gradient.&#8217;  &#8216;Awesome,&#8217; I naively thought.  &#8216;I can give it #purchases in each state, and two colors, and it&#8217;ll color the states along that gradient, similar to the tagroll on delicious.&#8217;  Not so.  After a little more digging, turns out what they&#8217;d meant by &#8216;gradient&#8217; was &#8216;a list of hex colors, one for each region you specify you want colored.&#8217;  Hmm.  Not quite as nice as I&#8217;d envisioned, but I could still make it work; I just had to discretize the colors and the groups of states corresponding to them.  I took the simplest route; 48 states, a gradient of 6 colors, and 8 states for each color.  There&#8217;d have been more contrast (probably) on the map had I factored the range of values(#crocs orders) into the algorithm, but after adding another DB to track purchases by state, and a few more corresponding lines to the perl script, with about an hour left I was more worried about other aspects of the project.</p>

<p>While I got the map working, Devin and Jared worked on styling, layout, and other content.  Devin, much more well-versed in modern web development tools than Jared or I, added HTML Boilerplate and picked a font.  Lacking the &#8216;what&#8217; or &#8216;why&#8217; of Boilerplate, Jared and I left Devin to &#8216;do his thing.&#8217;  Statistics from the DB were promptly pulled and displayed on the page (our only real content).</p>

<p>Reaching &#8216;crunch time,&#8217; and all three of us simultaneously making changes to the repo, it was git&#8217;s time to shine.  While Jared and I were new to git, both svn users in the past (Aside:  UW-CS is so focused on theory that I didn&#8217;t hear the word &#8216;version control&#8217; until my 2nd year.  None of my professors ever made any mention of development tools, save one fierce proponent of Emacs; I guess such knowledge is either assumed or ignored with a passing &#8216;they&#8217;ll figure it out later&#8217;), we still quickly realized that our setup was the definition of &#8216;wrong:&#8217; we had no push/pull triggers, and the &#8216;live&#8217; copy of the repo was simply one Jared had cloned into the document root.  Subsequently, for any changes we pushed, we had to say &#8216;Jared, please do a pull on the server copy.&#8217; Not ideal, and frankly embarrassing to admit, but it&#8217;s prompted me to learn how to properly use git, and is probably a bit humorous to those not directly involved.</p>

<p>We discussed making a javascript counter to keep track of time passed since our &#8216;Croc Epoch,&#8217; and agreed it would be super simple and wouldn&#8217;t even need a query; we&#8217;d just plug the time into the code itself.  Despite this, we still didn&#8217;t have time to implement it, and so ended up with a (much less impressive) static time field.</p>

<p>That was it.  A few quick CSS3 features (lipstick on a corpse?) and it was noon.  Time for the presentations.</p>

<p>We were told to keep them to around 3-5 minutes, and while we were worried about actually having enough material, other groups certainly didn&#8217;t have that problem; several went on for 15 or 20 minutes.  At this point we realized what we were up against:  most of the attendees were the business end of a startup, and were simply presenting ideas and mockups in the hopes of being funded.</p>

<p>So only a few groups had actually written most of their code in the past 24 hours; I think we may have been the only &#8216;from scratch&#8217; team.  The vast majority, it seemed, were months into their projects, idea-wise if not code-wise.  Needless to say, our presentation of &#8216;here&#8217;s what we did in a few hours, on a whim&#8217; didn&#8217;t exactly wow the judges, especially when compared to &#8216;Here&#8217;s this well-thought-out startup idea that, while not actually implemented yet, is still really cool and useful.&#8217;</p>

<p>Needless to say, we didn&#8217;t win anything.  Though Spreenkler had been given three $500 Zappos.com gift cards, and we were one of three teams to have used their API, we did not receive a gift card.  Not that I blame Spreenkler; I understand their decision; they couldn&#8217;t expect to award anything to an obviously impromptu entry without hearing endless frustrated complaints from the other entrants.  Still, I could&#8217;ve used some new shoes, and I do feel that we did more &#8216;hacking&#8217; at the event than most, if not all other teams.</p>

<p>In the end, I&#8217;m not sure how to feel about the experience.  I&#8217;m happy that I went, as I learned some new tricks, got to hang out with friends and enjoyed some free food.  At the same time, I worry about the reception of our efforts.</p>

<p>My final decision to enter the hackathon was based on the idea that a late entry was better than no entry at all.  It was also made under the assumption that this was a true build-something-in-24-hours event, which it certainly was not.  I can&#8217;t help but wonder if these misunderstandings caused us not to be taken seriously, or, worse yet, for Spreenkler to take offense to our well-intentioned entry.</p>

<p>If the latter is true, though, then our entry certainly did more harm than good.  I&#8217;d like to apologize to the Spreenkler team if that&#8217;s the case.  If they were able to see past our hasty submission to our genuine talent, though, that&#8217;s all I could have asked for.</p>

<p>P.S. I ended up implementing the aforementioned javascript counter a few days after the hackathon ended.  More for my peace of mind than anything else.  I ended up writing a short solution on my own, and then once it didn&#8217;t work immediately as I&#8217;d envisioned found a library someone else had written; I thought it was a good compromise.</p>

<p>And oh, yeah, here&#8217;s the (final?) product: <a href="http://crocepoch.com">CROC EPOCH</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I&#8217;ve mentioned the frustration I&#8217;ve been feeling with my work, and maybe I&#8217;ve even hinted that, in the back of my mind, I knew I just had to persevere.   But to hear someone as well-known and respected as Ira Glass say that these feelings, this &#8216;gap&#8217; (see below) is commonplace and almost expected in one&#8217;s career, was exactly what this post&#8217;s title suggests.</p>

<p>Am I still frustrated with the quality of my work?  Absolutely.  But whereas before I only had my own intuition to keep me going, I now have Ira Glass telling me it&#8217;s alright:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it&#8217;s just not that good. It&#8217;s trying to be good, it has potential, but it&#8217;s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://kottke.org/11/04/your-taste-is-why-your-own-work-disappoints-you">Here&#8217;s the page</a> where I found the interview, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI23U7U2aUY">embedded video</a> of part of it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 8:23am, and the future is bright.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve posted anything.  I&#8217;ve been pretty busy.</p>

<p>Between my new 9-5, an amazing girlfriend, the weather improving, several web projects and a few novels, my plate&#8217;s been plenty full.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not gotten any new projects lately, but I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of small(ish) changes/fixes to those I&#8217;ve already got going.  I&#8217;ve been considering having some kind of changelog for all my stuff in general, mostly to keep track of what I&#8217;m doing on a day-to-day basis.  I&#8217;ve started documenting such work but have yet to figure out a good place to share that with the rest of the world (or if that&#8217;s even necessary).  I mean,<em> I</em> know I&#8217;m doing the work, I just think it would be nice to let others know as well.</p>

<p>On that note, here&#8217;s some general stuff I&#8217;ve been working on since we last talked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added some stuff to lucy-dog.com, mostly aesthetic:

<ul>
<li>Changed title(s), metadata</li>
<li>Added a few new pictures</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting, paging issues with &#8216;show all&#8217;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broken Spoke Updates:

<ul>
<li>Migrated existing site to new host</li>
<li>Added Events functionality to DB, front-end, admin panel</li>
<li>Added, tweaked some .js libraries for picking dates and times (related to Events)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s all I can think of off the top of my head. I&#8217;ll let you know when I get an actual changelog documented.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reminded this last week that GoDaddy is a real pain if you don&#8217;t want to use their GUIs for everything.  Allowing SSH access took around 2 days to finally get implemented, after the DNS settings were populated.  I have yet to figure out how to use mysql from a shell; no combination of usernames and passwords allows me access, although those same credentials work everywhere else.  I&#8217;m sure PHPMyAdmin is a fine tool if you like that sort of thing, but I really just want access to a mysql prompt.  Is that so much to ask, GoDaddy?</p>

<p>On a related rant I have yet to find a good emacs script for multi-mode editing (PHP, javascript, html, css in this example). I tried a few but they weren&#8217;t really what I was looking for.  From what I remember (this was a few weeks back) one was very close, but its PHP-mode was all kinds of broken, to the point of unusability.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.</p>

<p>Almost done with the bike site, with the notable exception of graphics.  I am <em>absolutely</em> not a graphic designer, much as it pains me to admit.  I&#8217;ve taken on a few projects now where they&#8217;ve handed me a logo designed by someone for use as a sticker or on a t-shirt.  That&#8217;s great, but my Adobe fu isn&#8217;t such that I can easily make that into a pretty, well-laid-out header graphic.  Consequently graphics are what need the most improvement on these sites.  I&#8217;m getting better with Photoshop and Illustrator every day, but at this point I&#8217;d never take on a &#8216;design&#8217; project.  I truly appreciate nice graphics, and know what does and does not work or look good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I&#8217;m not a graphic designer.  I write code.  It&#8217;s one of those things where I think, &#8216;With some experience you can make some awesome logos!&#8217; and keep that in the back of my mind as I fumble with these design tools to produce graphics that don&#8217;t quite cut it.  Maybe I&#8217;ll eventually get there.  Maybe I&#8217;ll just hire a graphic designer.</p>

<p>On a less technical note, I finished Infinite Jest a few weeks ago.  Initially I was upset by the ending (if one wants to call it that), but after a day or two of subconscious processing I came to the opposite conclusion: that while certain elements of the story were not explicitly explained, there were plenty of clues and allusions to allow the reader to work things out for himself.  I liked that.  Apparently DFW&#8217;s last unfinished novel is out now, so I&#8217;m going to have to pick that up soon.</p>

<p>At Devin&#8217;s Mad Clojure Meetup last week I was referred to Logicomix, which I shortly thereafter bought and consumed.  The idea and format were what drew me immediately in:  a story about famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, in graphic novel format?  What&#8217;s not to like about that?  While the illustrations were amazing, I found the writing a little boring and sometimes awkwardly/ambiguously phrased.  While I understand that including in-depth details of the fields would have made the book inaccessible to a good majority of readers, that&#8217;s honestly what I was expecting and was a bit disappointed in that regard.  I felt that the book was too vague to be useful as anything more than a character-driven story and general history lesson.  Maybe that&#8217;s what they were going for; I just imagined that they would cater to the &#8216;nerd&#8217; audience a bit more.</p>

<p>Still looking for a job in Milwaukee.  Further updates as events warrant.</p>

    <h1 class="title">No Job, More Euler</h1>
    <div class="entry"><p>Worked on problems <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=23">23</a> and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=35">35</a> tonight.  Problem 23 was pretty straightforward, especially in Python:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Define a function that finds the sum of a number&#8217;s proper divisors</p></li>
<li><p>Create a list of all abundant numbers less than 28123</p></li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>set</strong> of sums resulting from the addition of each pair in the list described in 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a final set of numbers &lt; 28123 that are not in the set described in 3.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The answer is the sum of that last set. Easy enough, right?  I&#8217;ve been using the built-in <code>set</code> structure from Python where it makes sense (where I don&#8217;t want duplicates), although I&#8217;ve been doing so under the assumption that their duplicate handling is better-implemented than anything I would write after-the-fact.  I imagine they&#8217;re just doing some checks before actually appending, but I&#8217;m curious to learn exactly how they&#8217;re doing it, and if in fact I&#8217;m using set correctly in these instances.  Remind me to look that up later.</p>

<p>Figured I&#8217;d have 35 finished by the time I finished writing this, but my algorithm is apparently too naive, and requires something more than iterating through all primes under one million to find which are circular. Dang.  I&#8217;ll keep working on it after this, and post about it when I&#8217;m done.</p>

<p>Did a bit of work on the main site, mostly behind the scenes.  I actually designed a few logos today, as I plan on putting a banner/header at the top in place of my little &#8216;random statement&#8217; javascript thingy.  I&#8217;m moving toward making the front page more like the border-rounded, background-gradiented, &#8216;look at me I&#8217;m a 2.0 designer&#8217; designs you see everywhere these days.  Not because I agree with the aesthetic, but because I want to show that I can do that, too.</p>

<p>Super Bowl tomorrow.  I honestly haven&#8217;t payed very much attention this season, but having the Packers in the running always reminds me of the great Holmgren era, and thus of my childhood.  It&#8217;s always fun to watch a football game with friends, especially when I&#8217;m actually invested in a team, so tomorrow should be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Still no job, but I&#8217;m pretty much constantly in talks with recruiters.  The fact that in the past several months they&#8217;ve not managed to find me a job indicates that maybe they&#8217;re not the best way to go, but I remain confident in my competence and have no doubt that eventually someone else will recognize it as well.</p>

<p>In the meantime I&#8217;ll be calculating circular primes and learning from my mistakes.</p>

<p>Edit (12:16am):
Finished problem 35.  Pretty embarrassed about that one.  I was trying to speed up the algorithm by reducing the list of primes over which it was iterating, but wasn&#8217;t having much luck, until the daily facepalm:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Besides 2 and 5, circular primes&#8217; digits can only be 1,3,7, or 9.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The number of primes under one million? About 78k.  Those that also satisfy the above condition? 2500.</p>

<p>Problem 35 down.  33 problems done, 289 to go.</p>

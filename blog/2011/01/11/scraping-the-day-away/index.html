    <div class="entry"><p>So I&#8217;ve been tinkering with Ruby/Rails, using Mechanize to try and whip up a quick scraper for craigslist to aid me in my job search.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not a novel or particularly interesting idea, but practice is practice, right?  I feel like I&#8217;m learning <em>something</em> and I&#8217;m definitely not comfortable with the language, so that&#8217;s good, right?</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier how I was impressed with how easily I was able to retrieve an array of link objects from a given page (seriously, 2 lines).  That still stands.  It seems that craigslist is particularly difficult for this kind of task, or at least this particular tool (in how I&#8217;ve come to know it in these past few hours).  The problem is that craigslist&#8217;s DOM &#8216;tree&#8217; has lots of leaves.  These leaves are the data that I want.  So instead of using Mechanize&#8217;s neat features, I&#8217;m stuck basically just iterating through these leaves finding what I want.</p>

<p>That probably doesn&#8217;t make sense.  The point is, I need to learn more about all this before I actually try to write something.  In two hours I managed to write what&#8217;s basically just a compilation of several craigslist pages, and it works, but I know that this was a very, very naive approach.  I wrote a similar tool in Java over the summer for a job interview, and as it stands I&#8217;m not really using anything novel in the Ruby version (yet!).</p>

<p>The page is up on my site, but I&#8217;m not going to provide a link right now.  If you really cared (which you shouldn&#8217;t) you could probably find it.</p>

<p>This blog seems to have taken a somewhat negative turn as of the past few posts, so I wanted to say something about that:</p>

<blockquote><p>The point of this blog is to chronicle my technical projects, my personal life, and my job search.  What may be thought of as negative is generally the more interesting topic, for me at least.  I was discussing the shortcomings of this Ruby project not because I dislike Ruby but because I find it to be more helpful/thought-provoking than writing about some small success in said project.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think I&#8217;m done for the night.  Tomorrow&#8217;s goal: learn Ruby!</p>

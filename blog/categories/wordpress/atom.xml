    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m really tired but I wanted to make note of a few updates.  While I&rsquo;m not naive enough to think that the built-in comment system is the reason the blog doesn&rsquo;t have any comments, I realize that that could conceivably be an issue if the site actually had readers.  With that in mind, I present the new comment system, powered by <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>!</p>

<p>I finally got around to updating Wordpress this week as well.  I don&rsquo;t have FTP on my server for several reasons (mainly security), so Wordpress' handy dandy auto-install isn&rsquo;t an option for me (I suppose I could temporarily use it, but that&rsquo;s almost as much work as just doing it manually).  It&rsquo;s pretty painless since most of the files they update aren&rsquo;t ones I&rsquo;ve customized, but I always delay it because I fear change (and they update so damn often).</p>

<p>Made some minor style tweaks as well, probably nothing you&rsquo;ll notice.  $1 to anyone that does.</p>

<p>Next week should be pretty exciting (or at least blogworthy), so stay tuned for that.</p>

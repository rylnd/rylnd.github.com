    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything, but I&rsquo;ve been really, really busy.  Most importantly:  I <strong>quit my job to work for a startup</strong>.</p>

<p>I was approached by Steve at Spreenkler about two weeks ago.  He asked if I&rsquo;d be interested in working as a developer for one of the teams in their summer <a href="http://spreenklertalentlabs.org/startup/?page_id=4">Incubator Program</a>.  My old job was incredibly understanding about the opportunity, and after a few meetings and a trip to Milwaukee I was part of Jungol, Inc.  Expect a more detailed post about the team and what I&rsquo;m doing (hint: I&rsquo;m <em>the</em> developer) in the near future, when I have some more time.</p>

<p>Started doing some <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> problems.  I thought &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m getting it!&rdquo; until I enabled Golf Mode and saw how my problems (at least length-wise) compared to others' on the site.  Rest assured that I&rsquo;m working on it; I&rsquo;ve got the first 25 problems done so far.</p>

<p>I added a header to the site.  Not sure if I really like it, but it adds color and I didn&rsquo;t cringe upon seeing it the next day (stepping away from it for a while is always a good choice), so it&rsquo;s here to stay.  I&rsquo;ll be making small changes here and there, dependent on time and interest.</p>

<p>Frisbee is going good; we&rsquo;re 2-1 and we finally got our sweet jerseys.
It&rsquo;s been quite an ordeal trying to find an organize a team (yes, even for a &lsquo;sport&rsquo; like Ultimate Frisbee), but I&rsquo;m pretty damn happy with the results.  I&rsquo;ve been trying to organize everything on Google (Mail, Documents, Calendar) and while I created the tools for my team to use, I certainly can&rsquo;t force their utilization.  Oh, well.  At least people are showing up to games (and winning them).</p>

<p>Amanda and I went to the <a href="http://www.clipsoffaith.com/">Clips of Faith</a> Tour at Olin Park on Friday, and that was a blast.  Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really good beer, relatively cheap</li>
<li>Free handlebars upon entry</li>
<li>Entry to win the New Belgium cruiser</li>
<li>Delicious vegan nachos</li>
<li>Really cool short films</li>
</ul>


<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ve finally taken the leap and bought a MacBook Pro.  While I&rsquo;ve supported OS X in previous jobs I&rsquo;ve never actually owned or used it.  I&rsquo;m mostly using the terminal for development anyways, so work-wise it&rsquo;s not that big of a jump from linux.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m also <strong>moving from Emacs to vim</strong>, which is a more considerable jump.  I&rsquo;d used vim previously in college, but have done most of my serious programming with Emacs in the last year or two.  That&rsquo;s going much better than I would have expected, though.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready for any significant plugins right now but I&rsquo;m going to be using vim from now on and see how it goes.</p>

<p>The reason for vim?  Why, my third and final paradigm shift:  I&rsquo;m using Ruby on Rails as the framework for this startup project.  I spent last week learning as much as I could while getting my new workstation set up, and spent Saturday at Bendyworks for the Ruby Hack Day Meetup.  Everyone was super nice and helpful as usual; the only thing keeping me from learning more was my reluctance to speak up and ask for help.  I got a basic rails project up, and will be getting some actual guts in there this week.  The only thing I&rsquo;m missing is a testing framework (I&rsquo;m going to be using rspec, if any, but it&rsquo;s not in there yet).  I&rsquo;m currently debating whether unit testing would be reasonable at this point, given the already steep learning curve I&rsquo;m facing.  I&rsquo;m probably going to hold off for the first few basic features, and maybe reassess the situation in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Ruby/Rails hurdle is going to be a huge one, as I&rsquo;m quickly learning, but I&rsquo;m really excited to have this opportunity.  As a consequence I&rsquo;ve been doing more hacking than sleeping, and it&rsquo;s really starting to catch up with me.  It&rsquo;s an absolute blast, and in my mind it&rsquo;s not work at all, but my body is beginning to disagree with me.</p>

<p>On that note, I think it&rsquo;s time I rest my weary head a bit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m really tired but I wanted to make note of a few updates.  While I&rsquo;m not naive enough to think that the built-in comment system is the reason the blog doesn&rsquo;t have any comments, I realize that that could conceivably be an issue if the site actually had readers.  With that in mind, I present the new comment system, powered by <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>!</p>

<p>I finally got around to updating Wordpress this week as well.  I don&rsquo;t have FTP on my server for several reasons (mainly security), so Wordpress' handy dandy auto-install isn&rsquo;t an option for me (I suppose I could temporarily use it, but that&rsquo;s almost as much work as just doing it manually).  It&rsquo;s pretty painless since most of the files they update aren&rsquo;t ones I&rsquo;ve customized, but I always delay it because I fear change (and they update so damn often).</p>

<p>Made some minor style tweaks as well, probably nothing you&rsquo;ll notice.  $1 to anyone that does.</p>

<p>Next week should be pretty exciting (or at least blogworthy), so stay tuned for that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve posted anything.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy.</p>

<p>Between my new 9-5, an amazing girlfriend, the weather improving, several web projects and a few novels, my plate&rsquo;s been plenty full.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not gotten any new projects lately, but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of small(ish) changes/fixes to those I&rsquo;ve already got going.  I&rsquo;ve been considering having some kind of changelog for all my stuff in general, mostly to keep track of what I&rsquo;m doing on a day-to-day basis.  I&rsquo;ve started documenting such work but have yet to figure out a good place to share that with the rest of the world (or if that&rsquo;s even necessary).  I mean,<em> I</em> know I&rsquo;m doing the work, I just think it would be nice to let others know as well.</p>

<p>On that note, here&rsquo;s some general stuff I&rsquo;ve been working on since we last talked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added some stuff to lucy-dog.com, mostly aesthetic:

<ul>
<li>Changed title(s), metadata</li>
<li>Added a few new pictures</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting, paging issues with &lsquo;show all&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broken Spoke Updates:

<ul>
<li>Migrated existing site to new host</li>
<li>Added Events functionality to DB, front-end, admin panel</li>
<li>Added, tweaked some .js libraries for picking dates and times (related to Events)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all I can think of off the top of my head. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I get an actual changelog documented.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reminded this last week that GoDaddy is a real pain if you don&rsquo;t want to use their GUIs for everything.  Allowing SSH access took around 2 days to finally get implemented, after the DNS settings were populated.  I have yet to figure out how to use mysql from a shell; no combination of usernames and passwords allows me access, although those same credentials work everywhere else.  I&rsquo;m sure PHPMyAdmin is a fine tool if you like that sort of thing, but I really just want access to a mysql prompt.  Is that so much to ask, GoDaddy?</p>

<p>On a related rant I have yet to find a good emacs script for multi-mode editing (PHP, javascript, html, css in this example). I tried a few but they weren&rsquo;t really what I was looking for.  From what I remember (this was a few weeks back) one was very close, but its PHP-mode was all kinds of broken, to the point of unusability.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.</p>

<p>Almost done with the bike site, with the notable exception of graphics.  I am <em>absolutely</em> not a graphic designer, much as it pains me to admit.  I&rsquo;ve taken on a few projects now where they&rsquo;ve handed me a logo designed by someone for use as a sticker or on a t-shirt.  That&rsquo;s great, but my Adobe fu isn&rsquo;t such that I can easily make that into a pretty, well-laid-out header graphic.  Consequently graphics are what need the most improvement on these sites.  I&rsquo;m getting better with Photoshop and Illustrator every day, but at this point I&rsquo;d never take on a &lsquo;design&rsquo; project.  I truly appreciate nice graphics, and know what does and does not work or look good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I&rsquo;m not a graphic designer.  I write code.  It&rsquo;s one of those things where I think, &lsquo;With some experience you can make some awesome logos!&rsquo; and keep that in the back of my mind as I fumble with these design tools to produce graphics that don&rsquo;t quite cut it.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll eventually get there.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll just hire a graphic designer.</p>

<p>On a less technical note, I finished Infinite Jest a few weeks ago.  Initially I was upset by the ending (if one wants to call it that), but after a day or two of subconscious processing I came to the opposite conclusion: that while certain elements of the story were not explicitly explained, there were plenty of clues and allusions to allow the reader to work things out for himself.  I liked that.  Apparently DFW&rsquo;s last unfinished novel is out now, so I&rsquo;m going to have to pick that up soon.</p>

<p>At Devin&rsquo;s Mad Clojure Meetup last week I was referred to Logicomix, which I shortly thereafter bought and consumed.  The idea and format were what drew me immediately in:  a story about famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, in graphic novel format?  What&rsquo;s not to like about that?  While the illustrations were amazing, I found the writing a little boring and sometimes awkwardly/ambiguously phrased.  While I understand that including in-depth details of the fields would have made the book inaccessible to a good majority of readers, that&rsquo;s honestly what I was expecting and was a bit disappointed in that regard.  I felt that the book was too vague to be useful as anything more than a character-driven story and general history lesson.  Maybe that&rsquo;s what they were going for; I just imagined that they would cater to the &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; audience a bit more.</p>

<p>Still looking for a job in Milwaukee.  Further updates as events warrant.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>First: I started this post on Monday, but never got around to finishing it.</p>

<p>Went to the Mad Railers meetup Monday, despite my body requesting otherwise.  I figure if I don&#8217;t have the time to sit down and learn Ruby right myself right now, I should at least take advantage of these local groups.</p>

<p>The topic was testing, and while that might not be where most people would start when learning a new language (myself included), I have no doubts that it will help me in the long run.  There were a few great talks and I learned quite a bit.  I&#8217;m slowly putting the framework together in my mind, piece by piece.</p>

<p>My general approach to learning practical programming has been &#8216;abstraction is a treat that must be deserved.&#8217;  While higher-level languages are amazing and I absolutely cannot wait to use them professionally, at the same time I feel like I need to program a little &#8216;lower&#8217; for a while to appreciate and understand things to a reasonable degree.  Subsequently a good deal of what I do has holes and certainly isn&#8217;t as comprehensive as if I&#8217;d put the same amount of work on top of a template.  But finding and plugging those holes is a great learning experience.</p>

<p>Running my own VPS and web server has probably been the best project, education-wise.  There are certainly plenty of holes and configurations that go into system administration stuff, along with being great practice with bash.  I didn&#8217;t really get that when I was a student, but I&#8217;m sure glad I&#8217;m doing it now.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>In case this wasn&#8217;t apparent, I wanted to make it explicit real quickly:  all the blog posts thus far have been written on the fly.  I&#8217;ve not gone back and edited them in any major (or minor, for that matter) way;  I believe my stream-of-consciousness is coherent enough to follow without doing so, and I&#8217;m not trying to win any Pulitzers here anyway.</p>

<p>That being said, if something is unclear or obviously, distractingly wrong in one of my posts, please feel free to let me know and I&#8217;ll definitely look into making it clearer/correct.</p>

<p>I realize also that this disclaimer will likely only be read by me, so it&#8217;s probably more of a note to myself to be more conscious of those kinds of things while writing than an actual disclaimer to my (allegedly extant) readership.</p>

<p>Apparently the word of the day is &#8216;extant.&#8217;</p>

    <article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2011/05/09/my-first-hackathon-play-by-play/">My First Hackathon, Play by Play</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>I ran into a former coworker at Noodles last week, and when I mentioned I was moving to Milwaukee and looking for a job, he suggested I take a look at <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a>, a startup incubator based in Milwaukee.  I did some research and found that they were putting on a 24-hour hackathon over the weekend!  Realizing that this event combined three things I desperately needed: hacking experience, job opportunities (or at least some MKE networking), and free food, I decided I simply couldn&#8217;t pass it up.</p>

<p>This all happened on Thursday evening, with the event starting Saturday at noon. Sure it was short notice, but all coding was to be done on-site, right?  All we needed by Saturday was an idea.  While I had managed to convince a couple friends (Jared and Devin) to join my &#8216;team&#8217; on Friday evening, we still didn&#8217;t have an idea.  There was some mention of the Zappos API, but the team&#8217;s general indolence brought us to our final idea:  winging it.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, 12:00pm:</strong>  I felt a bit nervous walking in, as I&#8217;d never done any public coding before. All the more reason to start now though, right?  People slowly trickled in.  12:30pm: Time to announce our plans to everyone.  Uh oh.  We&#8217;d forgot about that.  We figured a plan would slowly form as we tinkered with the tools we were given; actually presenting that was going to be embarrassing, as everyone else seemed to have a solid game plan.  But we did.  Something along the lines of &#8216;We&#8217;re going to use the Zappos API.  That is all.&#8217;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, we had a team name and a git repo (Devin), both named Hot Biscuits (don&#8217;t ask me).  An encryption bug on my laptop prevented me from authenticating with github until I finally figured out a workaround; speed bump #1.</p>

<p>We tinkered with the API for a bit, and while the documentation didn&#8217;t exactly match what the API was sending us, we were able to figure it out pretty quick.  Jared got Apache running, Devin set up the DNS (and bought a new domain name, for funsies), and I got the initial databases up and running.  Not a bad start.</p>

<p>With a general structure in place, the next step was to start polling the API and storing the results.  Perl was suggested, as were ruby, clojure, and python.  I said I&#8217;d do this part, in python (due to previous experience), and set to work.  Jared took off for a bit to run some errands, and Devin, left waiting on my work, started writing the API->DB in clojure, being the fanboy that he is.</p>

<p>The script wasn&#8217;t as clean as I would have liked, because despite having a nice list of dicts to work with, I still had to quote the text being stored, and format the dates to appease the MySQL gods.  After a little bit, though, I had what looked like the correct sequence of SQL statements printing to stdout.  I changed the prints to executes, ran the script, and got &#8230; a whole bunch of encoding errors.  The problem involved some Unicode characters being sent back, and I figured I just had to specify UTF-8 as the encoding type and move right along.  Nope.  Not knowing about the default collation in MySQL, I suspected that might be the problem.  Nope.  Devin was still chugging away on his clojure implementation, and Jared, errands run, ended up writing a solution in perl that actually worked (eventually).  So by the afternoon we had three (mostly) working scripts that did exactly the same thing.  Efficiency!</p>

<p>With data now coming in, we realized the API made no guarantee about duplicates, so we made a few changes to uniques in the DB to prevent that from happening.  Confident that we could now slap a few data-visualization APIs on top of what we had and call it an MVP, we decided to break for dinner/loved ones.</p>

<p>We ended up meeting later that night for a bit to discuss the next morning&#8217;s game plan.  We mocked up a page layout, and planned on meeting back at the hackathon at 8:30 the next day (3 hours is plenty of time to do an entire front-end, right?). I also whipped up a craptacular logo before bed.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday Morning:</strong>  I reluctantly woke up a little before 8.  I was excited to work on the front-end, sure, but there are few things I value more than sleep (probably because I get so little of it during the work week).  Arrived at the building, and was immediately thwarted by locked doors; claims that the building would open again at 8am overlooked the fact that the building was officially closed on Sundays. I didn&#8217;t have the number for the room the event was using, but one of the coordinators fortuitously came down a few minutes later to let someone else in.  Phew.</p>

<p>I figured (correctly) that my teammates would be late, so set to work on writing an HTML skeleton and a basic stylesheet.  Tinkered for a little bit with color schemes and <a href="http://www.patternify.com/">Patternify</a>, an awesome CSS pattern generator that gives you the tile image&#8217;s base64 encoding, so you don&#8217;t even need a separate image file (pretty sweet, right? I even used it for the blog&#8217;s current bg).</p>

<p>Once my teammates showed up, the next few hours were a frantic, stressed blur.  We had location data, and we had brand data.  Someone whispered &#8220;Crocs.&#8221;  There it was: use our data to display statistics about Crocs purchases from Zappos.com.  A guaranteed winner; a tool everyone needed (they just didn&#8217;t know it yet).</p>

<p>The night before, I&#8217;d found a Google Charts API that could color a map.  It promised it could do so given a value for each region, and a &#8216;color gradient.&#8217;  &#8216;Awesome,&#8217; I naively thought.  &#8216;I can give it #purchases in each state, and two colors, and it&#8217;ll color the states along that gradient, similar to the tagroll on delicious.&#8217;  Not so.  After a little more digging, turns out what they&#8217;d meant by &#8216;gradient&#8217; was &#8216;a list of hex colors, one for each region you specify you want colored.&#8217;  Hmm.  Not quite as nice as I&#8217;d envisioned, but I could still make it work; I just had to discretize the colors and the groups of states corresponding to them.  I took the simplest route; 48 states, a gradient of 6 colors, and 8 states for each color.  There&#8217;d have been more contrast (probably) on the map had I factored the range of values(#crocs orders) into the algorithm, but after adding another DB to track purchases by state, and a few more corresponding lines to the perl script, with about an hour left I was more worried about other aspects of the project.</p>

<p>While I got the map working, Devin and Jared worked on styling, layout, and other content.  Devin, much more well-versed in modern web development tools than Jared or I, added HTML Boilerplate and picked a font.  Lacking the &#8216;what&#8217; or &#8216;why&#8217; of Boilerplate, Jared and I left Devin to &#8216;do his thing.&#8217;  Statistics from the DB were promptly pulled and displayed on the page (our only real content).</p>

<p>Reaching &#8216;crunch time,&#8217; and all three of us simultaneously making changes to the repo, it was git&#8217;s time to shine.  While Jared and I were new to git, both svn users in the past (Aside:  UW-CS is so focused on theory that I didn&#8217;t hear the word &#8216;version control&#8217; until my 2nd year.  None of my professors ever made any mention of development tools, save one fierce proponent of Emacs; I guess such knowledge is either assumed or ignored with a passing &#8216;they&#8217;ll figure it out later&#8217;), we still quickly realized that our setup was the definition of &#8216;wrong:&#8217; we had no push/pull triggers, and the &#8216;live&#8217; copy of the repo was simply one Jared had cloned into the document root.  Subsequently, for any changes we pushed, we had to say &#8216;Jared, please do a pull on the server copy.&#8217; Not ideal, and frankly embarrassing to admit, but it&#8217;s prompted me to learn how to properly use git, and is probably a bit humorous to those not directly involved.</p>

<p>We discussed making a javascript counter to keep track of time passed since our &#8216;Croc Epoch,&#8217; and agreed it would be super simple and wouldn&#8217;t even need a query; we&#8217;d just plug the time into the code itself.  Despite this, we still didn&#8217;t have time to implement it, and so ended up with a (much less impressive) static time field.</p>

<p>That was it.  A few quick CSS3 features (lipstick on a corpse?) and it was noon.  Time for the presentations.</p>

<p>We were told to keep them to around 3-5 minutes, and while we were worried about actually having enough material, other groups certainly didn&#8217;t have that problem; several went on for 15 or 20 minutes.  At this point we realized what we were up against:  most of the attendees were the business end of a startup, and were simply presenting ideas and mockups in the hopes of being funded.</p>

<p>So only a few groups had actually written most of their code in the past 24 hours; I think we may have been the only &#8216;from scratch&#8217; team.  The vast majority, it seemed, were months into their projects, idea-wise if not code-wise.  Needless to say, our presentation of &#8216;here&#8217;s what we did in a few hours, on a whim&#8217; didn&#8217;t exactly wow the judges, especially when compared to &#8216;Here&#8217;s this well-thought-out startup idea that, while not actually implemented yet, is still really cool and useful.&#8217;</p>

<p>Needless to say, we didn&#8217;t win anything.  Though Spreenkler had been given three $500 Zappos.com gift cards, and we were one of three teams to have used their API, we did not receive a gift card.  Not that I blame Spreenkler; I understand their decision; they couldn&#8217;t expect to award anything to an obviously impromptu entry without hearing endless frustrated complaints from the other entrants.  Still, I could&#8217;ve used some new shoes, and I do feel that we did more &#8216;hacking&#8217; at the event than most, if not all other teams.</p>

<p>In the end, I&#8217;m not sure how to feel about the experience.  I&#8217;m happy that I went, as I learned some new tricks, got to hang out with friends and enjoyed some free food.  At the same time, I worry about the reception of our efforts.</p>

<p>My final decision to enter the hackathon was based on the idea that a late entry was better than no entry at all.  It was also made under the assumption that this was a true build-something-in-24-hours event, which it certainly was not.  I can&#8217;t help but wonder if these misunderstandings caused us not to be taken seriously, or, worse yet, for Spreenkler to take offense to our well-intentioned entry.</p>

<p>If the latter is true, though, then our entry certainly did more harm than good.  I&#8217;d like to apologize to the Spreenkler team if that&#8217;s the case.  If they were able to see past our hasty submission to our genuine talent, though, that&#8217;s all I could have asked for.</p>

<p>P.S. I ended up implementing the aforementioned javascript counter a few days after the hackathon ended.  More for my peace of mind than anything else.  I ended up writing a short solution on my own, and then once it didn&#8217;t work immediately as I&#8217;d envisioned found a library someone else had written; I thought it was a good compromise.</p>

<p>And oh, yeah, here&#8217;s the (final?) product: <a href="http://crocepoch.com">CROC EPOCH</a></p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I know I&#8217;ve mentioned the frustration I&#8217;ve been feeling with my work, and maybe I&#8217;ve even hinted that, in the back of my mind, I knew I just had to persevere.   But to hear someone as well-known and respected as Ira Glass say that these feelings, this &#8216;gap&#8217; (see below) is commonplace and almost expected in one&#8217;s career, was exactly what this post&#8217;s title suggests.</p>

<p>Am I still frustrated with the quality of my work?  Absolutely.  But whereas before I only had my own intuition to keep me going, I now have Ira Glass telling me it&#8217;s alright:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it&#8217;s just not that good. It&#8217;s trying to be good, it has potential, but it&#8217;s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://kottke.org/11/04/your-taste-is-why-your-own-work-disappoints-you">Here&#8217;s the page</a> where I found the interview, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI23U7U2aUY">embedded video</a> of part of it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 8:23am, and the future is bright.</p>

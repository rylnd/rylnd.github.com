    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh snap.  Lots of exciting stuff happening lately.  Most publicly, I finally got some old code up on <a href="https://github.com/ryalnd">GitHub</a> a week or so ago.  &lsquo;Social Coding&rsquo; is such an amazingly cool concept, I deeply regret not participating sooner.  I literally get giddy when I load my dashboard.  It&rsquo;s probably love.  Follow me or just lurk; I&rsquo;ll be posting some more projects in the near future, and probably talking about it here.</p>

<p>In an exciting new development, Spreenkler has apparently changed their minds about the whole Zappos Gift Certificate thing (thanks to a rogue email by Devin, of which I swear I had no knowledge).  We&rsquo;ve yet to receive the goods, but Steve @ <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a> apparently talked to the guys at Blurbs and they agreed that we could have the award.  I was dumbfounded by the kindness exhibited in that gesture; if Steve and co. are representative of the Milwaukee community, I cannot wait.</p>

<p>Going along with that, I may have been offered an amazing opportunity for the summer that could really help kick-start things for me.  I&rsquo;ll give more details when things are more definite, but in the meantime I hope you&rsquo;re as excited as I am.</p>

<p>In other news, I finally checked my site out in IE today and it was HORRIBLE.  I&rsquo;m more generally of the stance &lsquo;F*** IE users&rsquo; but the overwhelming numbers and my inability to ignore a problem once it&rsquo;s noticed led me to fix things up.</p>

<p>I have so much stuff I want to read, code, and watch.  There aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day. &lsquo;night for now.</p>

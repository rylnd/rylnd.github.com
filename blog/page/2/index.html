    <div class="entry">
        <p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything, but I&#8217;ve been really, really busy.  Most importantly:  I <strong>quit my job to work for a startup</strong>.</p>

<p>I was approached by Steve at Spreenkler about two weeks ago.  He asked if I&#8217;d be interested in working as a developer for one of the teams in their summer <a href="http://spreenklertalentlabs.org/startup/?page_id=4">Incubator Program</a>.  My old job was incredibly understanding about the opportunity, and after a few meetings and a trip to Milwaukee I was part of Jungol, Inc.  Expect a more detailed post about the team and what I&#8217;m doing (hint: I&#8217;m <em>the</em> developer) in the near future, when I have some more time.</p>

<p>Started doing some <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> problems.  I thought &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m getting it!&#8221; until I enabled Golf Mode and saw how my problems (at least length-wise) compared to others&#8217; on the site.  Rest assured that I&#8217;m working on it; I&#8217;ve got the first 25 problems done so far.</p>

<p>I added a header to the site.  Not sure if I really like it, but it adds color and I didn&#8217;t cringe upon seeing it the next day (stepping away from it for a while is always a good choice), so it&#8217;s here to stay.  I&#8217;ll be making small changes here and there, dependent on time and interest.</p>

<p>Frisbee is going good; we&#8217;re 2-1 and we finally got our sweet jerseys.
It&#8217;s been quite an ordeal trying to find an organize a team (yes, even for a &#8216;sport&#8217; like Ultimate Frisbee), but I&#8217;m pretty damn happy with the results.  I&#8217;ve been trying to organize everything on Google (Mail, Documents, Calendar) and while I created the tools for my team to use, I certainly can&#8217;t force their utilization.  Oh, well.  At least people are showing up to games (and winning them).</p>

<p>Amanda and I went to the <a href="http://www.clipsoffaith.com/">Clips of Faith</a> Tour at Olin Park on Friday, and that was a blast.  Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really good beer, relatively cheap</li>
<li>Free handlebars upon entry</li>
<li>Entry to win the New Belgium cruiser</li>
<li>Delicious vegan nachos</li>
<li>Really cool short films</li>
</ul>


<p>Lastly, I&#8217;ve finally taken the leap and bought a MacBook Pro.  While I&#8217;ve supported OS X in previous jobs I&#8217;ve never actually owned or used it.  I&#8217;m mostly using the terminal for development anyways, so work-wise it&#8217;s not that big of a jump from linux.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m also <strong>moving from Emacs to vim</strong>, which is a more considerable jump.  I&#8217;d used vim previously in college, but have done most of my serious programming with Emacs in the last year or two.  That&#8217;s going much better than I would have expected, though.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for any significant plugins right now but I&#8217;m going to be using vim from now on and see how it goes.</p>

<p>The reason for vim?  Why, my third and final paradigm shift:  I&#8217;m using Ruby on Rails as the framework for this startup project.  I spent last week learning as much as I could while getting my new workstation set up, and spent Saturday at Bendyworks for the Ruby Hack Day Meetup.  Everyone was super nice and helpful as usual; the only thing keeping me from learning more was my reluctance to speak up and ask for help.  I got a basic rails project up, and will be getting some actual guts in there this week.  The only thing I&#8217;m missing is a testing framework (I&#8217;m going to be using rspec, if any, but it&#8217;s not in there yet).  I&#8217;m currently debating whether unit testing would be reasonable at this point, given the already steep learning curve I&#8217;m facing.  I&#8217;m probably going to hold off for the first few basic features, and maybe reassess the situation in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Ruby/Rails hurdle is going to be a huge one, as I&#8217;m quickly learning, but I&#8217;m really excited to have this opportunity.  As a consequence I&#8217;ve been doing more hacking than sleeping, and it&#8217;s really starting to catch up with me.  It&#8217;s an absolute blast, and in my mind it&#8217;s not work at all, but my body is beginning to disagree with me.</p>

<p>On that note, I think it&#8217;s time I rest my weary head a bit.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Okay, I&#8217;m really tired but I wanted to make note of a few updates.  While I&#8217;m not naive enough to think that the built-in comment system is the reason the blog doesn&#8217;t have any comments, I realize that that could conceivably be an issue if the site actually had readers.  With that in mind, I present the new comment system, powered by <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>!</p>

<p>I finally got around to updating Wordpress this week as well.  I don&#8217;t have FTP on my server for several reasons (mainly security), so Wordpress&#8217; handy dandy auto-install isn&#8217;t an option for me (I suppose I could temporarily use it, but that&#8217;s almost as much work as just doing it manually).  It&#8217;s pretty painless since most of the files they update aren&#8217;t ones I&#8217;ve customized, but I always delay it because I fear change (and they update so damn often).</p>

<p>Made some minor style tweaks as well, probably nothing you&#8217;ll notice.  $1 to anyone that does.</p>

<p>Next week should be pretty exciting (or at least blogworthy), so stay tuned for that.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2011/05/25/much-more-excitinger/">Much More Exciting(er)</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Oh snap.  Lots of exciting stuff happening lately.  Most publicly, I finally got some old code up on <a href="https://github.com/ryalnd">GitHub</a> a week or so ago.  &#8216;Social Coding&#8217; is such an amazingly cool concept, I deeply regret not participating sooner.  I literally get giddy when I load my dashboard.  It&#8217;s probably love.  Follow me or just lurk; I&#8217;ll be posting some more projects in the near future, and probably talking about it here.</p>

<p>In an exciting new development, Spreenkler has apparently changed their minds about the whole Zappos Gift Certificate thing (thanks to a rogue email by Devin, of which I swear I had no knowledge).  We&#8217;ve yet to receive the goods, but Steve @ <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a> apparently talked to the guys at Blurbs and they agreed that we could have the award.  I was dumbfounded by the kindness exhibited in that gesture; if Steve and co. are representative of the Milwaukee community, I cannot wait.</p>

<p>Going along with that, I may have been offered an amazing opportunity for the summer that could really help kick-start things for me.  I&#8217;ll give more details when things are more definite, but in the meantime I hope you&#8217;re as excited as I am.</p>

<p>In other news, I finally checked my site out in IE today and it was HORRIBLE.  I&#8217;m more generally of the stance &#8216;F*** IE users&#8217; but the overwhelming numbers and my inability to ignore a problem once it&#8217;s noticed led me to fix things up.</p>

<p>I have so much stuff I want to read, code, and watch.  There aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day. &#8216;night for now.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>First: I started this post on Monday, but never got around to finishing it.</p>

<p>Went to the Mad Railers meetup Monday, despite my body requesting otherwise.  I figure if I don&#8217;t have the time to sit down and learn Ruby right myself right now, I should at least take advantage of these local groups.</p>

<p>The topic was testing, and while that might not be where most people would start when learning a new language (myself included), I have no doubts that it will help me in the long run.  There were a few great talks and I learned quite a bit.  I&#8217;m slowly putting the framework together in my mind, piece by piece.</p>

<p>My general approach to learning practical programming has been &#8216;abstraction is a treat that must be deserved.&#8217;  While higher-level languages are amazing and I absolutely cannot wait to use them professionally, at the same time I feel like I need to program a little &#8216;lower&#8217; for a while to appreciate and understand things to a reasonable degree.  Subsequently a good deal of what I do has holes and certainly isn&#8217;t as comprehensive as if I&#8217;d put the same amount of work on top of a template.  But finding and plugging those holes is a great learning experience.</p>

<p>Running my own VPS and web server has probably been the best project, education-wise.  There are certainly plenty of holes and configurations that go into system administration stuff, along with being great practice with bash.  I didn&#8217;t really get that when I was a student, but I&#8217;m sure glad I&#8217;m doing it now.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power.</p>

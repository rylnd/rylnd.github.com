    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh, hey there!  It&rsquo;s been so long I almost didn&rsquo;t recognize you!  Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been good.  Real busy with work, if you can call it &lsquo;work.&rsquo;  Busy regardless, though.</p>

<p>The Jungol project has been going great.   I don&rsquo;t think I can overemphasize how refreshing it is.  The team, the framework, the project itself, and the freedom that I&rsquo;m given are amazing.  Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not grateful.</p>

<p>We had a bit of an uphill climb at first, make no mistake.  We needed to take the original idea, gather a whole lot of customer feedback, and decide what was most likely to succeed given those inputs.  This brings to mind an excellent quote I saw on Twitter the other day:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Entrepreneurship is like jumping off a cliff and assembling your airplane on the way down&rdquo;
&mdash; Reid Hoffman</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got the plane&rsquo;s body and most of its engine done.  Now we get to start her up and start adding paint and decals.  I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p>Ditching the metaphor and returning to reality, the lady and I will be heading to Milwaukee tomorrow to look at apartments.  It&rsquo;s going to be a welcome break from all the time spent staring at a terminal screen, but the overachiever in me is constantly nagging to &lsquo;get back to work.&rsquo;  We might stay and go to Summerfest on Sunday, depending on how my Ego feels.</p>

<p>We attended our first Concert on the Square on Wednesday, which was graciously hosted by the folks at The Firm.  They have a balcony overlooking the capitol, and were even nice enough to fill their office with food, beer, developers, entrepreneurs, and investors!  It was a fun time, to say the least.</p>

<p>Frisbee has had its ups and downs; some games we dominate, others we barely avoid a forfeit due to lack of players.  We&rsquo;re not the best in the league, but we&rsquo;re certainly not the worst.  Win or lose, though, we still get two free pitchers after every game. :)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what else to say right now.  Things are up in the air, and the future is uncertain, but I&rsquo;m having a blast and learning every day.   I am happy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything, but I&rsquo;ve been really, really busy.  Most importantly:  I <strong>quit my job to work for a startup</strong>.</p>

<p>I was approached by Steve at Spreenkler about two weeks ago.  He asked if I&rsquo;d be interested in working as a developer for one of the teams in their summer <a href="http://spreenklertalentlabs.org/startup/?page_id=4">Incubator Program</a>.  My old job was incredibly understanding about the opportunity, and after a few meetings and a trip to Milwaukee I was part of Jungol, Inc.  Expect a more detailed post about the team and what I&rsquo;m doing (hint: I&rsquo;m <em>the</em> developer) in the near future, when I have some more time.</p>

<p>Started doing some <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> problems.  I thought &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m getting it!&rdquo; until I enabled Golf Mode and saw how my problems (at least length-wise) compared to others' on the site.  Rest assured that I&rsquo;m working on it; I&rsquo;ve got the first 25 problems done so far.</p>

<p>I added a header to the site.  Not sure if I really like it, but it adds color and I didn&rsquo;t cringe upon seeing it the next day (stepping away from it for a while is always a good choice), so it&rsquo;s here to stay.  I&rsquo;ll be making small changes here and there, dependent on time and interest.</p>

<p>Frisbee is going good; we&rsquo;re 2-1 and we finally got our sweet jerseys.
It&rsquo;s been quite an ordeal trying to find an organize a team (yes, even for a &lsquo;sport&rsquo; like Ultimate Frisbee), but I&rsquo;m pretty damn happy with the results.  I&rsquo;ve been trying to organize everything on Google (Mail, Documents, Calendar) and while I created the tools for my team to use, I certainly can&rsquo;t force their utilization.  Oh, well.  At least people are showing up to games (and winning them).</p>

<p>Amanda and I went to the <a href="http://www.clipsoffaith.com/">Clips of Faith</a> Tour at Olin Park on Friday, and that was a blast.  Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really good beer, relatively cheap</li>
<li>Free handlebars upon entry</li>
<li>Entry to win the New Belgium cruiser</li>
<li>Delicious vegan nachos</li>
<li>Really cool short films</li>
</ul>


<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ve finally taken the leap and bought a MacBook Pro.  While I&rsquo;ve supported OS X in previous jobs I&rsquo;ve never actually owned or used it.  I&rsquo;m mostly using the terminal for development anyways, so work-wise it&rsquo;s not that big of a jump from linux.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m also <strong>moving from Emacs to vim</strong>, which is a more considerable jump.  I&rsquo;d used vim previously in college, but have done most of my serious programming with Emacs in the last year or two.  That&rsquo;s going much better than I would have expected, though.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready for any significant plugins right now but I&rsquo;m going to be using vim from now on and see how it goes.</p>

<p>The reason for vim?  Why, my third and final paradigm shift:  I&rsquo;m using Ruby on Rails as the framework for this startup project.  I spent last week learning as much as I could while getting my new workstation set up, and spent Saturday at Bendyworks for the Ruby Hack Day Meetup.  Everyone was super nice and helpful as usual; the only thing keeping me from learning more was my reluctance to speak up and ask for help.  I got a basic rails project up, and will be getting some actual guts in there this week.  The only thing I&rsquo;m missing is a testing framework (I&rsquo;m going to be using rspec, if any, but it&rsquo;s not in there yet).  I&rsquo;m currently debating whether unit testing would be reasonable at this point, given the already steep learning curve I&rsquo;m facing.  I&rsquo;m probably going to hold off for the first few basic features, and maybe reassess the situation in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Ruby/Rails hurdle is going to be a huge one, as I&rsquo;m quickly learning, but I&rsquo;m really excited to have this opportunity.  As a consequence I&rsquo;ve been doing more hacking than sleeping, and it&rsquo;s really starting to catch up with me.  It&rsquo;s an absolute blast, and in my mind it&rsquo;s not work at all, but my body is beginning to disagree with me.</p>

<p>On that note, I think it&rsquo;s time I rest my weary head a bit.</p>

    <id>http://rylnd.github.com/blog/2011/05/09/my-first-hackathon-play-by-play</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into a former coworker at Noodles last week, and when I mentioned I was moving to Milwaukee and looking for a job, he suggested I take a look at <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a>, a startup incubator based in Milwaukee.  I did some research and found that they were putting on a 24-hour hackathon over the weekend!  Realizing that this event combined three things I desperately needed: hacking experience, job opportunities (or at least some MKE networking), and free food, I decided I simply couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>

<p>This all happened on Thursday evening, with the event starting Saturday at noon. Sure it was short notice, but all coding was to be done on-site, right?  All we needed by Saturday was an idea.  While I had managed to convince a couple friends (Jared and Devin) to join my &lsquo;team&rsquo; on Friday evening, we still didn&rsquo;t have an idea.  There was some mention of the Zappos API, but the team&rsquo;s general indolence brought us to our final idea:  winging it.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, 12:00pm:</strong>  I felt a bit nervous walking in, as I&rsquo;d never done any public coding before. All the more reason to start now though, right?  People slowly trickled in.  12:30pm: Time to announce our plans to everyone.  Uh oh.  We&rsquo;d forgot about that.  We figured a plan would slowly form as we tinkered with the tools we were given; actually presenting that was going to be embarrassing, as everyone else seemed to have a solid game plan.  But we did.  Something along the lines of &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to use the Zappos API.  That is all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, we had a team name and a git repo (Devin), both named Hot Biscuits (don&rsquo;t ask me).  An encryption bug on my laptop prevented me from authenticating with github until I finally figured out a workaround; speed bump #1.</p>

<p>We tinkered with the API for a bit, and while the documentation didn&rsquo;t exactly match what the API was sending us, we were able to figure it out pretty quick.  Jared got Apache running, Devin set up the DNS (and bought a new domain name, for funsies), and I got the initial databases up and running.  Not a bad start.</p>

<p>With a general structure in place, the next step was to start polling the API and storing the results.  Perl was suggested, as were ruby, clojure, and python.  I said I&rsquo;d do this part, in python (due to previous experience), and set to work.  Jared took off for a bit to run some errands, and Devin, left waiting on my work, started writing the API->DB in clojure, being the fanboy that he is.</p>

<p>The script wasn&rsquo;t as clean as I would have liked, because despite having a nice list of dicts to work with, I still had to quote the text being stored, and format the dates to appease the MySQL gods.  After a little bit, though, I had what looked like the correct sequence of SQL statements printing to stdout.  I changed the prints to executes, ran the script, and got &hellip; a whole bunch of encoding errors.  The problem involved some Unicode characters being sent back, and I figured I just had to specify UTF-8 as the encoding type and move right along.  Nope.  Not knowing about the default collation in MySQL, I suspected that might be the problem.  Nope.  Devin was still chugging away on his clojure implementation, and Jared, errands run, ended up writing a solution in perl that actually worked (eventually).  So by the afternoon we had three (mostly) working scripts that did exactly the same thing.  Efficiency!</p>

<p>With data now coming in, we realized the API made no guarantee about duplicates, so we made a few changes to uniques in the DB to prevent that from happening.  Confident that we could now slap a few data-visualization APIs on top of what we had and call it an MVP, we decided to break for dinner/loved ones.</p>

<p>We ended up meeting later that night for a bit to discuss the next morning&rsquo;s game plan.  We mocked up a page layout, and planned on meeting back at the hackathon at 8:30 the next day (3 hours is plenty of time to do an entire front-end, right?). I also whipped up a craptacular logo before bed.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday Morning:</strong>  I reluctantly woke up a little before 8.  I was excited to work on the front-end, sure, but there are few things I value more than sleep (probably because I get so little of it during the work week).  Arrived at the building, and was immediately thwarted by locked doors; claims that the building would open again at 8am overlooked the fact that the building was officially closed on Sundays. I didn&rsquo;t have the number for the room the event was using, but one of the coordinators fortuitously came down a few minutes later to let someone else in.  Phew.</p>

<p>I figured (correctly) that my teammates would be late, so set to work on writing an HTML skeleton and a basic stylesheet.  Tinkered for a little bit with color schemes and <a href="http://www.patternify.com/">Patternify</a>, an awesome CSS pattern generator that gives you the tile image&rsquo;s base64 encoding, so you don&rsquo;t even need a separate image file (pretty sweet, right? I even used it for the blog&rsquo;s current bg).</p>

<p>Once my teammates showed up, the next few hours were a frantic, stressed blur.  We had location data, and we had brand data.  Someone whispered &ldquo;Crocs.&rdquo;  There it was: use our data to display statistics about Crocs purchases from Zappos.com.  A guaranteed winner; a tool everyone needed (they just didn&rsquo;t know it yet).</p>

<p>The night before, I&rsquo;d found a Google Charts API that could color a map.  It promised it could do so given a value for each region, and a &lsquo;color gradient.&rsquo;  &lsquo;Awesome,&rsquo; I naively thought.  &lsquo;I can give it #purchases in each state, and two colors, and it&rsquo;ll color the states along that gradient, similar to the tagroll on delicious.&rsquo;  Not so.  After a little more digging, turns out what they&rsquo;d meant by &lsquo;gradient&rsquo; was &lsquo;a list of hex colors, one for each region you specify you want colored.&rsquo;  Hmm.  Not quite as nice as I&rsquo;d envisioned, but I could still make it work; I just had to discretize the colors and the groups of states corresponding to them.  I took the simplest route; 48 states, a gradient of 6 colors, and 8 states for each color.  There&rsquo;d have been more contrast (probably) on the map had I factored the range of values(#crocs orders) into the algorithm, but after adding another DB to track purchases by state, and a few more corresponding lines to the perl script, with about an hour left I was more worried about other aspects of the project.</p>

<p>While I got the map working, Devin and Jared worked on styling, layout, and other content.  Devin, much more well-versed in modern web development tools than Jared or I, added HTML Boilerplate and picked a font.  Lacking the &lsquo;what&rsquo; or &lsquo;why&rsquo; of Boilerplate, Jared and I left Devin to &lsquo;do his thing.&rsquo;  Statistics from the DB were promptly pulled and displayed on the page (our only real content).</p>

<p>Reaching &lsquo;crunch time,&rsquo; and all three of us simultaneously making changes to the repo, it was git&rsquo;s time to shine.  While Jared and I were new to git, both svn users in the past (Aside:  UW-CS is so focused on theory that I didn&rsquo;t hear the word &lsquo;version control&rsquo; until my 2nd year.  None of my professors ever made any mention of development tools, save one fierce proponent of Emacs; I guess such knowledge is either assumed or ignored with a passing &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll figure it out later&rsquo;), we still quickly realized that our setup was the definition of &lsquo;wrong:&rsquo; we had no push/pull triggers, and the &lsquo;live&rsquo; copy of the repo was simply one Jared had cloned into the document root.  Subsequently, for any changes we pushed, we had to say &lsquo;Jared, please do a pull on the server copy.&rsquo; Not ideal, and frankly embarrassing to admit, but it&rsquo;s prompted me to learn how to properly use git, and is probably a bit humorous to those not directly involved.</p>

<p>We discussed making a javascript counter to keep track of time passed since our &lsquo;Croc Epoch,&rsquo; and agreed it would be super simple and wouldn&rsquo;t even need a query; we&rsquo;d just plug the time into the code itself.  Despite this, we still didn&rsquo;t have time to implement it, and so ended up with a (much less impressive) static time field.</p>

<p>That was it.  A few quick CSS3 features (lipstick on a corpse?) and it was noon.  Time for the presentations.</p>

<p>We were told to keep them to around 3-5 minutes, and while we were worried about actually having enough material, other groups certainly didn&rsquo;t have that problem; several went on for 15 or 20 minutes.  At this point we realized what we were up against:  most of the attendees were the business end of a startup, and were simply presenting ideas and mockups in the hopes of being funded.</p>

<p>So only a few groups had actually written most of their code in the past 24 hours; I think we may have been the only &lsquo;from scratch&rsquo; team.  The vast majority, it seemed, were months into their projects, idea-wise if not code-wise.  Needless to say, our presentation of &lsquo;here&rsquo;s what we did in a few hours, on a whim&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t exactly wow the judges, especially when compared to &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s this well-thought-out startup idea that, while not actually implemented yet, is still really cool and useful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Needless to say, we didn&rsquo;t win anything.  Though Spreenkler had been given three $500 Zappos.com gift cards, and we were one of three teams to have used their API, we did not receive a gift card.  Not that I blame Spreenkler; I understand their decision; they couldn&rsquo;t expect to award anything to an obviously impromptu entry without hearing endless frustrated complaints from the other entrants.  Still, I could&rsquo;ve used some new shoes, and I do feel that we did more &lsquo;hacking&rsquo; at the event than most, if not all other teams.</p>

<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m not sure how to feel about the experience.  I&rsquo;m happy that I went, as I learned some new tricks, got to hang out with friends and enjoyed some free food.  At the same time, I worry about the reception of our efforts.</p>

<p>My final decision to enter the hackathon was based on the idea that a late entry was better than no entry at all.  It was also made under the assumption that this was a true build-something-in-24-hours event, which it certainly was not.  I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if these misunderstandings caused us not to be taken seriously, or, worse yet, for Spreenkler to take offense to our well-intentioned entry.</p>

<p>If the latter is true, though, then our entry certainly did more harm than good.  I&rsquo;d like to apologize to the Spreenkler team if that&rsquo;s the case.  If they were able to see past our hasty submission to our genuine talent, though, that&rsquo;s all I could have asked for.</p>

<p>P.S. I ended up implementing the aforementioned javascript counter a few days after the hackathon ended.  More for my peace of mind than anything else.  I ended up writing a short solution on my own, and then once it didn&rsquo;t work immediately as I&rsquo;d envisioned found a library someone else had written; I thought it was a good compromise.</p>

<p>And oh, yeah, here&rsquo;s the (final?) product: <a href="http://crocepoch.com">CROC EPOCH</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In case this wasn&rsquo;t apparent, I wanted to make it explicit real quickly:  all the blog posts thus far have been written on the fly.  I&rsquo;ve not gone back and edited them in any major (or minor, for that matter) way;  I believe my stream-of-consciousness is coherent enough to follow without doing so, and I&rsquo;m not trying to win any Pulitzers here anyway.</p>

<p>That being said, if something is unclear or obviously, distractingly wrong in one of my posts, please feel free to let me know and I&rsquo;ll definitely look into making it clearer/correct.</p>

<p>I realize also that this disclaimer will likely only be read by me, so it&rsquo;s probably more of a note to myself to be more conscious of those kinds of things while writing than an actual disclaimer to my (allegedly extant) readership.</p>

<p>Apparently the word of the day is &lsquo;extant.&rsquo;</p>

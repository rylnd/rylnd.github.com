		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling very well today, and it was super cold out, so I decided to be as productive as I possibly could at home.  This involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updating profiles/resumes on various job sites</li>
<li>Searching and applying for jobs on same</li>
<li>Doing some stalking of Milwaukee-area businesses</li>
<li>Finally setting up, lurking IRC</li>
<li>Several PE problems as a reward</li>
</ul>


<p>Most of those are self-explanatory.  I finally updated the pdf version of my resume to reflect the changes made to my html version, and then updated any references to the old one.  I can&rsquo;t believe that Monster only accepts resumes in .rtf, .doc, and .txt.  I&rsquo;ve mostly ignored Monster for the simple fact that I have a horribly-formatted .rtf on there and refuse to change it out of principle.  If an employer isn&rsquo;t going to hire me because I only provide html and pdf versions of my resume, so be it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to compile a list of possible Milwaukee-area businesses I would like to work for, so that I can start spamming them my resume :).  I finally got irssi set up on this box, as I haven&rsquo;t been on IRC in a looooong while.  I&rsquo;ve been lurking #python while doing Project Euler, and actually gave my first piece of help to someone on the channel as well.  It had almost nothing to do with python, as it was a pretty basic regex question about character classes, but I helped nonetheless.</p>

<p>Did problems <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=26">26</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=40">40</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=42">42</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=45">45</a>, and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=52">52</a> tonight. Not bad progress for a few hours.  I also wrote a solution to problem <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=27">27</a>, but it&rsquo;s still running as I write this.  I think I&rsquo;m going to let it run overnight and see if it actually finishes (totally against the rules, I know).  It deals with quadratics though and I couldn&rsquo;t immediately see any way to narrow down the list of possible coefficients, so I just tried brute-force.  I&rsquo;ll let it stew in my head for a while and see if I come up with anything.</p>

<p>Not much of note for these, they were pretty straightforward.  I did write a function that performed long-division for problem 26, which I thought was pretty hilarious.  It was the easiest way to determine whether the decimal had a repeating sequence, the length of said sequence.  I got the idea from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal#Decimal_expansion_and_recurrence_sequence">Wikipedia</a>, if you care to see.  There was some more I/O, which was nice to have as practice, and I&rsquo;m using dicts and sets, maps and lambdas all over the place now.  Slow and steady, right?</p>

<p>I know I keep promising to post my code, and as I&rsquo;ve been saving it the only real thing keeping me from doing so is my shyness at others seeing that code.  I might select the simplest, most elegant examples, but if you&rsquo;d like to see how I came to a particular solution I&rsquo;d be more than willing to share.  I&rsquo;m going to try to use IRC for help with refactoring some code.  My biggest concern is that I&rsquo;m not doing everything in true &lsquo;pythonic&rsquo; manner, so I think getting help there will reduce the shyness.</p>

<p>On the income front, I have two potential web-design contracts coming in, from friends of friends.  It&rsquo;ll be good practice and that&rsquo;s really what I need right now, more than income (although more of that would be nice, too).  All temp/contract web/IT work I&rsquo;ve tried to attain has fallen through the cracks.  It&rsquo;s frustrating but what can you do.  I&rsquo;m trying to stay positive and not starve to death.  So far so good.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still real cold here (0°), but it&rsquo;s looking to get in the 40s by Sunday, which is awesome.  I think we&rsquo;re going to try and go sledding tomorrow!  Fun and exercise; I could use both.</p>

<p>I also wanted to mention that I hilariously added a &lsquo;Like&rsquo; button to each post on the blog.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone is even reading these, let alone considering &lsquo;liking&rsquo; them, but I figure if and when they do that&rsquo;ll definitely help to get some traffic.  At this point the only traffic I could really hope for are those doing Project Euler, which is minimal at best, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<p>Worked on problems <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=23">23</a> and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=35">35</a> tonight.  Problem 23 was pretty straightforward, especially in Python:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Define a function that finds the sum of a number&rsquo;s proper divisors</p></li>
<li><p> Create a list of all abundant numbers less than 28123</p></li>
<li><p> Create a <strong>set</strong> of sums resulting from the addition of each pair in the list described in 2.</p></li>
<li><p> Create a final set of numbers &lt; 28123 that are not in the set described in 3.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The answer is the sum of that last set. Easy enough, right?  I&rsquo;ve been using the built-in <code>set</code> structure from Python where it makes sense (where I don&rsquo;t want duplicates), although I&rsquo;ve been doing so under the assumption that their duplicate handling is better-implemented than anything I would write after-the-fact.  I imagine they&rsquo;re just doing some checks before actually appending, but I&rsquo;m curious to learn exactly how they&rsquo;re doing it, and if in fact I&rsquo;m using set correctly in these instances.  Remind me to look that up later.</p>

<p>Figured I&rsquo;d have 35 finished by the time I finished writing this, but my algorithm is apparently too naive, and requires something more than iterating through all primes under one million to find which are circular. Dang.  I&rsquo;ll keep working on it after this, and post about it when I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<p>Did a bit of work on the main site, mostly behind the scenes.  I actually designed a few logos today, as I plan on putting a banner/header at the top in place of my little &lsquo;random statement&rsquo; javascript thingy.  I&rsquo;m moving toward making the front page more like the border-rounded, background-gradiented, &lsquo;look at me I&rsquo;m a 2.0 designer&rsquo; designs you see everywhere these days.  Not because I agree with the aesthetic, but because I want to show that I can do that, too.</p>

<p>Super Bowl tomorrow.  I honestly haven&rsquo;t payed very much attention this season, but having the Packers in the running always reminds me of the great Holmgren era, and thus of my childhood.  It&rsquo;s always fun to watch a football game with friends, especially when I&rsquo;m actually invested in a team, so tomorrow should be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Still no job, but I&rsquo;m pretty much constantly in talks with recruiters.  The fact that in the past several months they&rsquo;ve not managed to find me a job indicates that maybe they&rsquo;re not the best way to go, but I remain confident in my competence and have no doubt that eventually someone else will recognize it as well.</p>

<p>In the meantime I&rsquo;ll be calculating circular primes and learning from my mistakes.</p>

<p>Edit (12:16am):
Finished problem 35.  Pretty embarrassed about that one.  I was trying to speed up the algorithm by reducing the list of primes over which it was iterating, but wasn&rsquo;t having much luck, until the daily facepalm:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Besides 2 and 5, circular primes&#8217; digits can only be 1,3,7, or 9.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The number of primes under one million? About 78k.  Those that also satisfy the above condition? 2500.</p>

<p>Problem 35 down.  33 problems done, 289 to go.</p>

		<p>Woke up to the promise of a blizzard.</p>

<p>I was supposed to head down to Kenosha for a dentist&rsquo;s appointment this morning, but that was canceled due to weather; it wasn&rsquo;t a crucial appointment, and I really didn&rsquo;t want to be stuck there until Wednesday/Thursday.</p>

<p>Today also marked the first Mad Railers meeting I was (supposed to be) attending, but weather and lack of suitable transportation left me home coding instead.  I tried to make myself feel better with some Ruby/Rails research/education and rationalizing that my lack of knowledge in that framework would prevent me from learning/contributing much at such a meeting, but I&rsquo;m still bummed that I missed it and have yet to attend.  Next month&rsquo;s meeting is marked in red on the calendar.</p>

<p>PE update:  Did problems <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=24">24</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=36">36</a>, and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=34">34</a> today, in that order.  24 was the most interesting; I had started on a solution to it a few days ago.  I knew from my Combinatorics class how to represent permutations as a list of inversions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Given a set of n digits, each permutation of that set can be written as a list of n-1 numbers, say i(0)-i(n-1), where i(n) represents the number of inversions with respect to n. You only need n-1 numbers in the list/vector, as the last is implied(same idea as degrees of freedom in stats).</p></blockquote>

<p>If the original set is in lexicographic order, i.e. 12345, the easiest way to explain, say,  i(3) is as the count of numbers out of order with respect to 3.  If the permutation is 23145, the inversion vector(list) would be [1100].</p>

<p>This means that 2 has one number out of order (1), as does 3 (also 1).  Remember though, that inversions in general are just a pair(x,y), and a permutation can be defined as the list of pairwise-flips (inversions) it takes to get from the original number/set/whatever.</p>

<p>So, knowing that, I basically jumped into writing a solution as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The starting, 0th permutation is 0123456789</li>
<li>I would manually write out the next x permutations, in lexicographic order, along with the corresponding inversion vectors, in the hopes of seeing a pattern regarding the list of inversion vectors.

<ul>
<li>I did this under the idea that calculating 1,000,000 10-digit numbers in a certain way would be much faster than actually doing the permuting manually, one million times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I did this for what ended up being the first 24 permutations, which corresponded to permutations of only the last 4 digits, and ended up with something like Table A:</p>

<h5 style='margin:0.5em 0;'>Table A</h5>

<p>Not seeing a pattern?  Neither did I.  It starts out looking like it&rsquo;s just counting up in binary, but then a 2 pops up, and there aren&rsquo;t any nice rules like, say, &lsquo;they increase in value from L to R&rsquo; because of cases like 8679.</p>

<p>I tried in vain to see/reverse-engineer a pattern from this list of vectors, and eventually gave up for the night.   I knew that I was on the right track, that somehow the order in which these items were inverted to preserve lexicographic order wasn&rsquo;t just random.  As with some of my past PE solutions, the key came from a little bit of research: I was browsing Wikipedia&rsquo;s entry on permutations, when I came to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Numbering_permutations">this</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that definitely looked promising.  After a bit more reading and clicking links, I came upon Table B (found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system#Examples">here</a>):</p>

<p>Ok, so they&rsquo;re not exactly the same.  I think the irregularities come from my non-standard, on-the-fly way of representing permutations, but you can imagine my excitement when I found that table.  It meant my hunch was right, and the main point was this:  <strong>Listing permutations in lexicographic order yields a pattern of inversion vectors, and this pattern corresponds directly to the factoradic representation of that permutation&rsquo;s order in that list.  </strong>Or, to quote Wikipedia a few lines down:</p>

<p><em>There is a natural mapping between the integers 0, &hellip;, n! − 1 (or equivalently the numbers with n digits in factorial representation) and permutations of n elements in lexicographical order, when the integers are expressed in factoradic form. This mapping has been termed the Lehmer code (or inversion table).</em></p>

<p>Well, there you have it.  The trick comes from writing a decimal in factoradic form, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>15 = 2110! = 2*3! + 1*2! + 1*1! + 0*0!
</code></pre>

<p>and 2110 as an inversion vector corresponds to the permutation 2130, which is:</p>

<blockquote><p>The 15th permutation of 0123. Yay!</p></blockquote>

<p>So I had my answer.  To find the millionth lexicographic permutation of 0123456789, all I had to do was find the factoradic representation of 999999 (off by one), which would map to an inversion vector, from which I could find the permutation.  And find it I did.</p>

<p>After that, 36 and 34 were easy.  For 36 I just wrote a function <code>is_pal()</code> that takes a string and returns whether or not it&rsquo;s palindromic (and now I know how to get the binary representation of an int!).  34 was even easier: I reused the factorial function I had just written for 24 (I know there are built-in ones now; I wanted to write my own).</p>

<p>Hopefully tomorrow won&rsquo;t get snowed out.</p>

		<p>Project Euler Update: I&rsquo;ve still been plugging away at various PE problems.
I finally finished my first 25(26 now) problems, earning me a &lsquo;Level 1&rsquo; status which from what I can tell is just a title.  But it&rsquo;s <em>my</em> title!
So, I know I talked about showing some code, and I still plan to post all the solutions I&rsquo;ve written, but to whet your appetites here&rsquo;s a quick, straightforward solution to problem 30:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2019448.js?file=p30.py'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>def split(str): return sum(int(x)**5 for x in str)
print sum(i for i in range(2, 999999) if i == split(str(i)))</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Nothing too special going on here (though I&rsquo;m finally getting the hang of list comprehensions).  It&rsquo;s basically brute force, which from what I&rsquo;ve seen on the forums is really the only way it&rsquo;s been done. The <code>split()</code> function gets the value for a given number(passed as a string, not an int), and the next line finds all numbers fitting the criteria of the problem. The solution space of 2-999,999 comes from the fact that since the maximum value for a digit is 9<sup>5</sup> = 59049, no number with 7 or more digits could possibly be part of the solution since 7 x 9<sup>5</sup> = 413,343 &lt;&lt;&lt; 9,999,999.</p>

<p>Tonight&rsquo;s the first week of the Stand-Up Competition at the Comedy Club.  I was there for part of last year&rsquo;s, and since a cheap comedy show is the pastime of choice for poor, unemployed, narcissistic college graduates around the world, I plan on being a regular attendee for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I don&rsquo;t like the look of the site, anymore.  I&rsquo;ll be changing things around soon, or maybe just tweaking, so check back.</p>

<p>EDIT(7:02pm):  I felt like a bum for not doing any PE today, so I just did problem 29 with:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2019448.js?file=p29.py'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>print len(set(a**b for a in range(2,101) for b in range(2,101)))</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>using python&rsquo;s <code>set</code> structure to avoid having to remove duplicates myself.</p>

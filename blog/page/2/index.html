        <p>Oh, hey there!  It&#8217;s been so long I almost didn&#8217;t recognize you!  Yeah, I&#8217;ve been good.  Real busy with work, if you can call it &#8216;work.&#8217;  Busy regardless, though.</p>

<p>The Jungol project has been going great.   I don&#8217;t think I can overemphasize how refreshing it is.  The team, the framework, the project itself, and the freedom that I&#8217;m given are amazing.  Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m not grateful.</p>

<p>We had a bit of an uphill climb at first, make no mistake.  We needed to take the original idea, gather a whole lot of customer feedback, and decide what was most likely to succeed given those inputs.  This brings to mind an excellent quote I saw on Twitter the other day:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Entrepreneurship is like jumping off a cliff and assembling your airplane on the way down&#8221;
&#8211; Reid Hoffman</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve got the plane&#8217;s body and most of its engine done.  Now we get to start her up and start adding paint and decals.  I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>Ditching the metaphor and returning to reality, the lady and I will be heading to Milwaukee tomorrow to look at apartments.  It&#8217;s going to be a welcome break from all the time spent staring at a terminal screen, but the overachiever in me is constantly nagging to &#8216;get back to work.&#8217;  We might stay and go to Summerfest on Sunday, depending on how my Ego feels.</p>

<p>We attended our first Concert on the Square on Wednesday, which was graciously hosted by the folks at The Firm.  They have a balcony overlooking the capitol, and were even nice enough to fill their office with food, beer, developers, entrepreneurs, and investors!  It was a fun time, to say the least.</p>

<p>Frisbee has had its ups and downs; some games we dominate, others we barely avoid a forfeit due to lack of players.  We&#8217;re not the best in the league, but we&#8217;re certainly not the worst.  Win or lose, though, we still get two free pitchers after every game. :)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really know what else to say right now.  Things are up in the air, and the future is uncertain, but I&#8217;m having a blast and learning every day.   I am happy.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2011/06/12/busyness-business/">Busyness, Business</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything, but I&#8217;ve been really, really busy.  Most importantly:  I <strong>quit my job to work for a startup</strong>.</p>

<p>I was approached by Steve at Spreenkler about two weeks ago.  He asked if I&#8217;d be interested in working as a developer for one of the teams in their summer <a href="http://spreenklertalentlabs.org/startup/?page_id=4">Incubator Program</a>.  My old job was incredibly understanding about the opportunity, and after a few meetings and a trip to Milwaukee I was part of Jungol, Inc.  Expect a more detailed post about the team and what I&#8217;m doing (hint: I&#8217;m <em>the</em> developer) in the near future, when I have some more time.</p>

<p>Started doing some <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> problems.  I thought &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m getting it!&#8221; until I enabled Golf Mode and saw how my problems (at least length-wise) compared to others&#8217; on the site.  Rest assured that I&#8217;m working on it; I&#8217;ve got the first 25 problems done so far.</p>

<p>I added a header to the site.  Not sure if I really like it, but it adds color and I didn&#8217;t cringe upon seeing it the next day (stepping away from it for a while is always a good choice), so it&#8217;s here to stay.  I&#8217;ll be making small changes here and there, dependent on time and interest.</p>

<p>Frisbee is going good; we&#8217;re 2-1 and we finally got our sweet jerseys.
It&#8217;s been quite an ordeal trying to find an organize a team (yes, even for a &#8216;sport&#8217; like Ultimate Frisbee), but I&#8217;m pretty damn happy with the results.  I&#8217;ve been trying to organize everything on Google (Mail, Documents, Calendar) and while I created the tools for my team to use, I certainly can&#8217;t force their utilization.  Oh, well.  At least people are showing up to games (and winning them).</p>

<p>Amanda and I went to the <a href="http://www.clipsoffaith.com/">Clips of Faith</a> Tour at Olin Park on Friday, and that was a blast.  Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really good beer, relatively cheap</li>
<li>Free handlebars upon entry</li>
<li>Entry to win the New Belgium cruiser</li>
<li>Delicious vegan nachos</li>
<li>Really cool short films</li>
</ul>


<p>Lastly, I&#8217;ve finally taken the leap and bought a MacBook Pro.  While I&#8217;ve supported OS X in previous jobs I&#8217;ve never actually owned or used it.  I&#8217;m mostly using the terminal for development anyways, so work-wise it&#8217;s not that big of a jump from linux.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m also <strong>moving from Emacs to vim</strong>, which is a more considerable jump.  I&#8217;d used vim previously in college, but have done most of my serious programming with Emacs in the last year or two.  That&#8217;s going much better than I would have expected, though.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for any significant plugins right now but I&#8217;m going to be using vim from now on and see how it goes.</p>

<p>The reason for vim?  Why, my third and final paradigm shift:  I&#8217;m using Ruby on Rails as the framework for this startup project.  I spent last week learning as much as I could while getting my new workstation set up, and spent Saturday at Bendyworks for the Ruby Hack Day Meetup.  Everyone was super nice and helpful as usual; the only thing keeping me from learning more was my reluctance to speak up and ask for help.  I got a basic rails project up, and will be getting some actual guts in there this week.  The only thing I&#8217;m missing is a testing framework (I&#8217;m going to be using rspec, if any, but it&#8217;s not in there yet).  I&#8217;m currently debating whether unit testing would be reasonable at this point, given the already steep learning curve I&#8217;m facing.  I&#8217;m probably going to hold off for the first few basic features, and maybe reassess the situation in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Ruby/Rails hurdle is going to be a huge one, as I&#8217;m quickly learning, but I&#8217;m really excited to have this opportunity.  As a consequence I&#8217;ve been doing more hacking than sleeping, and it&#8217;s really starting to catch up with me.  It&#8217;s an absolute blast, and in my mind it&#8217;s not work at all, but my body is beginning to disagree with me.</p>

<p>On that note, I think it&#8217;s time I rest my weary head a bit.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Okay, I&#8217;m really tired but I wanted to make note of a few updates.  While I&#8217;m not naive enough to think that the built-in comment system is the reason the blog doesn&#8217;t have any comments, I realize that that could conceivably be an issue if the site actually had readers.  With that in mind, I present the new comment system, powered by <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>!</p>

<p>I finally got around to updating Wordpress this week as well.  I don&#8217;t have FTP on my server for several reasons (mainly security), so Wordpress&#8217; handy dandy auto-install isn&#8217;t an option for me (I suppose I could temporarily use it, but that&#8217;s almost as much work as just doing it manually).  It&#8217;s pretty painless since most of the files they update aren&#8217;t ones I&#8217;ve customized, but I always delay it because I fear change (and they update so damn often).</p>

<p>Made some minor style tweaks as well, probably nothing you&#8217;ll notice.  $1 to anyone that does.</p>

<p>Next week should be pretty exciting (or at least blogworthy), so stay tuned for that.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2011/05/25/much-more-excitinger/">Much More Exciting(er)</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Oh snap.  Lots of exciting stuff happening lately.  Most publicly, I finally got some old code up on <a href="https://github.com/ryalnd">GitHub</a> a week or so ago.  &#8216;Social Coding&#8217; is such an amazingly cool concept, I deeply regret not participating sooner.  I literally get giddy when I load my dashboard.  It&#8217;s probably love.  Follow me or just lurk; I&#8217;ll be posting some more projects in the near future, and probably talking about it here.</p>

<p>In an exciting new development, Spreenkler has apparently changed their minds about the whole Zappos Gift Certificate thing (thanks to a rogue email by Devin, of which I swear I had no knowledge).  We&#8217;ve yet to receive the goods, but Steve @ <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a> apparently talked to the guys at Blurbs and they agreed that we could have the award.  I was dumbfounded by the kindness exhibited in that gesture; if Steve and co. are representative of the Milwaukee community, I cannot wait.</p>

<p>Going along with that, I may have been offered an amazing opportunity for the summer that could really help kick-start things for me.  I&#8217;ll give more details when things are more definite, but in the meantime I hope you&#8217;re as excited as I am.</p>

<p>In other news, I finally checked my site out in IE today and it was HORRIBLE.  I&#8217;m more generally of the stance &#8216;F*** IE users&#8217; but the overwhelming numbers and my inability to ignore a problem once it&#8217;s noticed led me to fix things up.</p>

<p>I have so much stuff I want to read, code, and watch.  There aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day. &#8216;night for now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently trying to deploy a heroku instance for some testing. I hadn't done any work on heroku in a while, and ended up getting stuck on a credentials issue.</p>

<p>While I had successfully done a <code>$ gem install heroku &amp;&amp; heroku create --stack cedar</code>, I got the following error when trying to do a <code>$ git push heroku master</code> to get things up and running:</p>

<pre><code>!  Your key with fingerprint 09:84:27:65:48:de:b4:48:fe:64:25:d8:dd:55:d8:db is not authorized to access evening-snow-7878.

fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm.  That looked like an ssh issue to me. A quick <code>$ ssh-keygen -l</code> of a few of my keys told me that it was using the 'wrong one,' which was my default ssh key.</p>

<p>Looking at <code>$ heroku keys</code> didn't help; it was using the correct key. So the issue was with my ssh config, not the heroku gem or its configuration.</p>

<p>I quickly tried to add an entry to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file, along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>Host heroku.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/the_key_you_want
</code></pre>

<p>But I still got the same error: it was still using the wrong key. I did some quick googling and couldn't find a good answer.  I eventually stumbled on this <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-accounts">excellent heroku plugin</a> that does exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<p>However, if you aren't using many accounts, and don't want to type a command in each terminal session, here's what it's doing under the covers (and what I ended up doing):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add something like the following to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>Host heroku.app_name
  HostName heroku.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/the_key_you_want
  IdentitiesOnly yes
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add a remote to your repo using that host:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add heroku git@heroku.app_name:app_name.git
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>That should be it. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I&#8217;m really tired but I wanted to make note of a few updates.  While I&#8217;m not naive enough to think that the built-in comment system is the reason the blog doesn&#8217;t have any comments, I realize that that could conceivably be an issue if the site actually had readers.  With that in mind, I present the new comment system, powered by <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>!</p>

<p>I finally got around to updating Wordpress this week as well.  I don&#8217;t have FTP on my server for several reasons (mainly security), so Wordpress&#8217; handy dandy auto-install isn&#8217;t an option for me (I suppose I could temporarily use it, but that&#8217;s almost as much work as just doing it manually).  It&#8217;s pretty painless since most of the files they update aren&#8217;t ones I&#8217;ve customized, but I always delay it because I fear change (and they update so damn often).</p>

<p>Made some minor style tweaks as well, probably nothing you&#8217;ll notice.  $1 to anyone that does.</p>

<p>Next week should be pretty exciting (or at least blogworthy), so stay tuned for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh snap.  Lots of exciting stuff happening lately.  Most publicly, I finally got some old code up on <a href="https://github.com/ryalnd">GitHub</a> a week or so ago.  &#8216;Social Coding&#8217; is such an amazingly cool concept, I deeply regret not participating sooner.  I literally get giddy when I load my dashboard.  It&#8217;s probably love.  Follow me or just lurk; I&#8217;ll be posting some more projects in the near future, and probably talking about it here.</p>

<p>In an exciting new development, Spreenkler has apparently changed their minds about the whole Zappos Gift Certificate thing (thanks to a rogue email by Devin, of which I swear I had no knowledge).  We&#8217;ve yet to receive the goods, but Steve @ <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a> apparently talked to the guys at Blurbs and they agreed that we could have the award.  I was dumbfounded by the kindness exhibited in that gesture; if Steve and co. are representative of the Milwaukee community, I cannot wait.</p>

<p>Going along with that, I may have been offered an amazing opportunity for the summer that could really help kick-start things for me.  I&#8217;ll give more details when things are more definite, but in the meantime I hope you&#8217;re as excited as I am.</p>

<p>In other news, I finally checked my site out in IE today and it was HORRIBLE.  I&#8217;m more generally of the stance &#8216;F*** IE users&#8217; but the overwhelming numbers and my inability to ignore a problem once it&#8217;s noticed led me to fix things up.</p>

<p>I have so much stuff I want to read, code, and watch.  There aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day. &#8216;night for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First: I started this post on Monday, but never got around to finishing it.</p>

<p>Went to the Mad Railers meetup Monday, despite my body requesting otherwise.  I figure if I don&#8217;t have the time to sit down and learn Ruby right myself right now, I should at least take advantage of these local groups.</p>

<p>The topic was testing, and while that might not be where most people would start when learning a new language (myself included), I have no doubts that it will help me in the long run.  There were a few great talks and I learned quite a bit.  I&#8217;m slowly putting the framework together in my mind, piece by piece.</p>

<p>My general approach to learning practical programming has been &#8216;abstraction is a treat that must be deserved.&#8217;  While higher-level languages are amazing and I absolutely cannot wait to use them professionally, at the same time I feel like I need to program a little &#8216;lower&#8217; for a while to appreciate and understand things to a reasonable degree.  Subsequently a good deal of what I do has holes and certainly isn&#8217;t as comprehensive as if I&#8217;d put the same amount of work on top of a template.  But finding and plugging those holes is a great learning experience.</p>

<p>Running my own VPS and web server has probably been the best project, education-wise.  There are certainly plenty of holes and configurations that go into system administration stuff, along with being great practice with bash.  I didn&#8217;t really get that when I was a student, but I&#8217;m sure glad I&#8217;m doing it now.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case this wasn&#8217;t apparent, I wanted to make it explicit real quickly:  all the blog posts thus far have been written on the fly.  I&#8217;ve not gone back and edited them in any major (or minor, for that matter) way;  I believe my stream-of-consciousness is coherent enough to follow without doing so, and I&#8217;m not trying to win any Pulitzers here anyway.</p>

<p>That being said, if something is unclear or obviously, distractingly wrong in one of my posts, please feel free to let me know and I&#8217;ll definitely look into making it clearer/correct.</p>

<p>I realize also that this disclaimer will likely only be read by me, so it&#8217;s probably more of a note to myself to be more conscious of those kinds of things while writing than an actual disclaimer to my (allegedly extant) readership.</p>

<p>Apparently the word of the day is &#8216;extant.&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t posted anything in a while. I won&#8217;t make excuses, that&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>If you hadn&#8217;t noticed, the blog is no longer WordPress, nor is it hosted on my Linode. A few weeks ago, during <a href="http://bendyworks.com">bendyworks</a>&#8217; amazing growth days (which will be described in a future post), I converted my blog entries to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>-formatted YAML and markdown. This was actually the hardest part of the process. I won&#8217;t go into details, but it involved piping my WordPress-exported posts through a Rube-Goldbergesque series of Python libraries.</p>

<p>With my old posts converted, I then got an <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> repository set up on GitHub, using their super-cool <a href="http://pages.github.com">Pages</a> functionality for hosting and super-easy deployment. The whole process is very slick, and requires much, much less effort, maintenance, money, and disk space than my former methods.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be tweaking the look and content in the weeks to come; I just wanted to give an update (mostly so that my newest post wasn&#8217;t a year old).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hoo boy.  A lot has changed in the past few weeks.  After spending about a month looking for jobs and apartments in Milwaukee, we finally found both.  We found the perfect apartment, and I accepted a job offer for an awesome Django startup in Spreenkler&#8217;s Accelerator program.  The day after I said yes to the job, I was approached with an offer here in Madison.  While both were amazing jobs, I ended up taking the job here in Madison as I felt it had more to offer, experientially.  Starting at the end of August, I&#8217;ll be an official <a href="http://bendyworks.com/">Bendyworker</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this means that the time Amanda and I spent planning for Milwaukee was basically for naught.  I&#8217;ve got an amazing job, but we&#8217;re back to square one apartment-wise.  I&#8217;ve moved every year since 2005; I&#8217;m ready to buy a house out of sheer laziness.</p>

<p>Speaking of laziness, I&#8217;ve been working day and night on our startup, <a href="http://jungolhq.com">Jungol</a>.  We just launched our alpha tonight, after much internal tinkering.  I&#8217;ve read time and again that the best thing you can do is just put your project out there, so it&#8217;s something of a relief to finally have done so.  Check it out at <a href="http://jng.li/qJ338J">http://jng.li/qJ338J</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of smaller things that still need to be done, but most everything&#8217;s there right now.  We&#8217;ve got our proof of concept; the rest is up to the public (who told us they wanted this, we swear).  It&#8217;s an exciting time and I&#8217;m proud to be a part of the whole thing.  Having written the entire site save for design, it&#8217;s becoming like a child to me, but I&#8217;m trying my best not to become too emotionally attached.</p>

<p>Our final frisbee game is next Tuesday.   Our <em>championship</em> frisbee game, that is.  This last week was playoffs, and we won both games.  I&#8217;m pretty proud of the team; we had a lot of beginners, some who&#8217;d never even played a team sport before, but we&#8217;ve come together and are playing amazingly well.  Playing with the same team every year is comforting, I&#8217;m sure, but there&#8217;s something to be said for this amazing transition from &#8216;group of people&#8217; to &#8216;team&#8217; over the course of a season.  Remind me to let you know if we won or not.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve got a great job and a great girlfriend.  Let me know if you see any great apartments for rent around town.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh, hey there!  It&#8217;s been so long I almost didn&#8217;t recognize you!  Yeah, I&#8217;ve been good.  Real busy with work, if you can call it &#8216;work.&#8217;  Busy regardless, though.</p>

<p>The Jungol project has been going great.   I don&#8217;t think I can overemphasize how refreshing it is.  The team, the framework, the project itself, and the freedom that I&#8217;m given are amazing.  Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m not grateful.</p>

<p>We had a bit of an uphill climb at first, make no mistake.  We needed to take the original idea, gather a whole lot of customer feedback, and decide what was most likely to succeed given those inputs.  This brings to mind an excellent quote I saw on Twitter the other day:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Entrepreneurship is like jumping off a cliff and assembling your airplane on the way down&#8221;
&#8211; Reid Hoffman</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve got the plane&#8217;s body and most of its engine done.  Now we get to start her up and start adding paint and decals.  I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>Ditching the metaphor and returning to reality, the lady and I will be heading to Milwaukee tomorrow to look at apartments.  It&#8217;s going to be a welcome break from all the time spent staring at a terminal screen, but the overachiever in me is constantly nagging to &#8216;get back to work.&#8217;  We might stay and go to Summerfest on Sunday, depending on how my Ego feels.</p>

<p>We attended our first Concert on the Square on Wednesday, which was graciously hosted by the folks at The Firm.  They have a balcony overlooking the capitol, and were even nice enough to fill their office with food, beer, developers, entrepreneurs, and investors!  It was a fun time, to say the least.</p>

<p>Frisbee has had its ups and downs; some games we dominate, others we barely avoid a forfeit due to lack of players.  We&#8217;re not the best in the league, but we&#8217;re certainly not the worst.  Win or lose, though, we still get two free pitchers after every game. :)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really know what else to say right now.  Things are up in the air, and the future is uncertain, but I&#8217;m having a blast and learning every day.   I am happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything, but I&#8217;ve been really, really busy.  Most importantly:  I <strong>quit my job to work for a startup</strong>.</p>

<p>I was approached by Steve at Spreenkler about two weeks ago.  He asked if I&#8217;d be interested in working as a developer for one of the teams in their summer <a href="http://spreenklertalentlabs.org/startup/?page_id=4">Incubator Program</a>.  My old job was incredibly understanding about the opportunity, and after a few meetings and a trip to Milwaukee I was part of Jungol, Inc.  Expect a more detailed post about the team and what I&#8217;m doing (hint: I&#8217;m <em>the</em> developer) in the near future, when I have some more time.</p>

<p>Started doing some <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> problems.  I thought &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m getting it!&#8221; until I enabled Golf Mode and saw how my problems (at least length-wise) compared to others&#8217; on the site.  Rest assured that I&#8217;m working on it; I&#8217;ve got the first 25 problems done so far.</p>

<p>I added a header to the site.  Not sure if I really like it, but it adds color and I didn&#8217;t cringe upon seeing it the next day (stepping away from it for a while is always a good choice), so it&#8217;s here to stay.  I&#8217;ll be making small changes here and there, dependent on time and interest.</p>

<p>Frisbee is going good; we&#8217;re 2-1 and we finally got our sweet jerseys.
It&#8217;s been quite an ordeal trying to find an organize a team (yes, even for a &#8216;sport&#8217; like Ultimate Frisbee), but I&#8217;m pretty damn happy with the results.  I&#8217;ve been trying to organize everything on Google (Mail, Documents, Calendar) and while I created the tools for my team to use, I certainly can&#8217;t force their utilization.  Oh, well.  At least people are showing up to games (and winning them).</p>

<p>Amanda and I went to the <a href="http://www.clipsoffaith.com/">Clips of Faith</a> Tour at Olin Park on Friday, and that was a blast.  Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Really good beer, relatively cheap</li>
<li>Free handlebars upon entry</li>
<li>Entry to win the New Belgium cruiser</li>
<li>Delicious vegan nachos</li>
<li>Really cool short films</li>
</ul>


<p>Lastly, I&#8217;ve finally taken the leap and bought a MacBook Pro.  While I&#8217;ve supported OS X in previous jobs I&#8217;ve never actually owned or used it.  I&#8217;m mostly using the terminal for development anyways, so work-wise it&#8217;s not that big of a jump from linux.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m also <strong>moving from Emacs to vim</strong>, which is a more considerable jump.  I&#8217;d used vim previously in college, but have done most of my serious programming with Emacs in the last year or two.  That&#8217;s going much better than I would have expected, though.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for any significant plugins right now but I&#8217;m going to be using vim from now on and see how it goes.</p>

<p>The reason for vim?  Why, my third and final paradigm shift:  I&#8217;m using Ruby on Rails as the framework for this startup project.  I spent last week learning as much as I could while getting my new workstation set up, and spent Saturday at Bendyworks for the Ruby Hack Day Meetup.  Everyone was super nice and helpful as usual; the only thing keeping me from learning more was my reluctance to speak up and ask for help.  I got a basic rails project up, and will be getting some actual guts in there this week.  The only thing I&#8217;m missing is a testing framework (I&#8217;m going to be using rspec, if any, but it&#8217;s not in there yet).  I&#8217;m currently debating whether unit testing would be reasonable at this point, given the already steep learning curve I&#8217;m facing.  I&#8217;m probably going to hold off for the first few basic features, and maybe reassess the situation in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Ruby/Rails hurdle is going to be a huge one, as I&#8217;m quickly learning, but I&#8217;m really excited to have this opportunity.  As a consequence I&#8217;ve been doing more hacking than sleeping, and it&#8217;s really starting to catch up with me.  It&#8217;s an absolute blast, and in my mind it&#8217;s not work at all, but my body is beginning to disagree with me.</p>

<p>On that note, I think it&#8217;s time I rest my weary head a bit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it's been a bit since I've posted anything.  I've been pretty busy.</p>

<p>Between my new 9-5, an amazing girlfriend, the weather improving, several web projects and a few novels, my plate's been plenty full.</p>

<p>I've not gotten any new projects lately, but I've been doing a lot of small(ish) changes/fixes to those I've already got going.  I've been considering having some kind of changelog for all my stuff in general, mostly to keep track of what I'm doing on a day-to-day basis.  I've started documenting such work but have yet to figure out a good place to share that with the rest of the world (or if that's even necessary).  I mean,<em> I</em> know I'm doing the work, I just think it would be nice to let others know as well.</p>

<p>On that note, here's some general stuff I've been working on since we last talked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added some stuff to lucy-dog.com, mostly aesthetic:

<ul>
<li>Changed title(s), metadata</li>
<li>Added a few new pictures</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting, paging issues with 'show all'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broken Spoke Updates:

<ul>
<li>Migrated existing site to new host</li>
<li>Added Events functionality to DB, front-end, admin panel</li>
<li>Added, tweaked some .js libraries for picking dates and times (related to Events)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That's all I can think of off the top of my head. I'll let you know when I get an actual changelog documented.</p>

<p>I've been reminded this last week that GoDaddy is a real pain if you don't want to use their GUIs for everything.  Allowing SSH access took around 2 days to finally get implemented, after the DNS settings were populated.  I have yet to figure out how to use mysql from a shell; no combination of usernames and passwords allows me access, although those same credentials work everywhere else.  I'm sure PHPMyAdmin is a fine tool if you like that sort of thing, but I really just want access to a mysql prompt.  Is that so much to ask, GoDaddy?</p>

<p>On a related rant I have yet to find a good emacs script for multi-mode editing (PHP, javascript, html, css in this example). I tried a few but they weren't really what I was looking for.  From what I remember (this was a few weeks back) one was very close, but its PHP-mode was all kinds of broken, to the point of unusability.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.</p>

<p>Almost done with the bike site, with the notable exception of graphics.  I am <em>absolutely</em> not a graphic designer, much as it pains me to admit.  I've taken on a few projects now where they've handed me a logo designed by someone for use as a sticker or on a t-shirt.  That's great, but my Adobe fu isn't such that I can easily make that into a pretty, well-laid-out header graphic.  Consequently graphics are what need the most improvement on these sites.  I'm getting better with Photoshop and Illustrator every day, but at this point I'd never take on a 'design' project.  I truly appreciate nice graphics, and know what does and does not work or look good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I'm not a graphic designer.  I write code.  It's one of those things where I think, 'With some experience you can make some awesome logos!' and keep that in the back of my mind as I fumble with these design tools to produce graphics that don't quite cut it.  Maybe I'll eventually get there.  Maybe I'll just hire a graphic designer.</p>

<p>On a less technical note, I finished Infinite Jest a few weeks ago.  Initially I was upset by the ending (if one wants to call it that), but after a day or two of subconscious processing I came to the opposite conclusion: that while certain elements of the story were not explicitly explained, there were plenty of clues and allusions to allow the reader to work things out for himself.  I liked that.  Apparently DFW's last unfinished novel is out now, so I'm going to have to pick that up soon.</p>

<p>At Devin's Mad Clojure Meetup last week I was referred to Logicomix, which I shortly thereafter bought and consumed.  The idea and format were what drew me immediately in:  a story about famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, in graphic novel format?  What's not to like about that?  While the illustrations were amazing, I found the writing a little boring and sometimes awkwardly/ambiguously phrased.  While I understand that including in-depth details of the fields would have made the book inaccessible to a good majority of readers, that's honestly what I was expecting and was a bit disappointed in that regard.  I felt that the book was too vague to be useful as anything more than a character-driven story and general history lesson.  Maybe that's what they were going for; I just imagined that they would cater to the 'nerd' audience a bit more.</p>

<p>Still looking for a job in Milwaukee.  Further updates as events warrant.</p>

	<div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I last posted.  Quite a bit&rsquo;s happened in that time.</p>

<p>To begin, I finally found a job.  Starting Wednesday I&rsquo;ll be working a regular 9-to-5, doing primarily technical support for pharmacy software.  While it&rsquo;s only a temporary position and doesn&rsquo;t involve much development, I&rsquo;m still really looking forward to some structure and a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; circadian rhythm.  I consider myself one of those people that loves to work, and get genuine satisfaction from doing a job well.  Also, it&rsquo;s well-paying and I&rsquo;m dead broke; that certainly doesn&rsquo;t hamper my anticipation.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done any Project Euler since I reached Level 2.  I felt it was a good stopping point for the time being, but I&rsquo;ve definitely learned a lot from it and plan on doing a problem or two when the urge strikes; perhaps in a new language.  It&rsquo;s been really good for learning syntax and structure basics for Python, and at this point I feel confident that I could pretty easily solve most problems with it.  If you&rsquo;re looking to learn a new language, applications (in the literal sense) to math problems are in my opinion a great way to start.</p>

<p>Still working on a couple of web development contracts, both for starting businesses.  They&rsquo;re going well, although the biggest problem I&rsquo;m having is with the level of detail to which I&rsquo;m giving these sites.  I&rsquo;m trying to keep things quick and simple, but jQuery and PHP make doing all these awesome things so simple that I end up spending wayyy too much time experimenting with features the client neither asked for nor particularly needs.  Giving them more than they asked for up-front isn&rsquo;t really a problem in itself (deleting is pretty simple), but it&rsquo;s becoming one given that these need to get finished post-haste since time will be sparse come tomorrow.</p>

<p>Finally, I launched a site last week called (tentatively): <a href="http://lucy-dog.com">Lucy In Hats</a>.  It started out as a joking comment about my girlfriend&rsquo;s dog, and within a few hours I had bought a domain name and had something up and running.  I&rsquo;ve been making tweaks and adding features since then, but the concept&rsquo;s been the same since the start: people vote on pictures of an adorable mini-pug in silly hats.</p>

<p>I ended up going through with the idea because I wanted to see how much traffic I could generate to the site, under the general knowledge that people can&rsquo;t get enough of cute animals.  That and learning the underlying technologies needed for a relatively simple site like this were my main goals for the project. The fact I only had to spend $10 on a domain name got things off the ground right away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done some &lsquo;advertising&rsquo; on Facebook, both on my account and on the lady&rsquo;s; beyond that I&rsquo;ve been relying on word-of-mouth and people&rsquo;s attraction to cuteness.  I&rsquo;d say he site is a success even at this point, at least as compared to ry-land.com and this blog.</p>

<p>As of right now I&rsquo;ve had around 10x as many unique visitors to the site as to ry-land.com, and about 35x as many page views.  Granted, I haven&rsquo;t advertised ry-land.com on Facebook, nor is there dynamic content to drive all those page views, but I&rsquo;m still pretty impressed by its popularity in the first week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really cranking out the jQuery and PHP and doing new stuff with them every day.  I&rsquo;m enjoying it, learning a bunch, and tomorrow I should even start making some money again.  Not bad.</p>

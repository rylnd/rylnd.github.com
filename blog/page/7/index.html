		<p>So I came upon problem 15 last night, after finishing up 12, 13, and 14.  Though I was done for the night, and an obvious solution wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent, I knew one thing: buried in my mind somewhere is the answer to this problem.  I knew I had done math like this before, I just had to figure out to what class this problem belonged.</p>

<p>That, though, turned out to be pretty frustrating.  I turned off my monitor and tried to sleep, but couldn&rsquo;t help thinking about the problem.  At first I tried to think of the grid as a graph (which was obviously easy), with intersections being nodes and lines edges, under the assumption that perhaps this was some type of network flow problem.  I soon realized that this was a much simpler problem than that, which made me consider it even more (instead of sleeping, mind).</p>

<p>The arrows in the diagram apparently threw me at first; this was not a network problem.  I started thinking along the right lines as soon as I dozed off: I knew it wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; to think of the grid as a graph, with limited paths, and that a choice was being made at each node (whether to go down or right).  The rest came just right now.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t consciously thought of it until my mind came back to it just now.  The breakthrough came when I realized that each possible path was of the same length (W + L or 2L, same here) and consisted of an equal number (here, L) of &lsquo;down&rsquo; and &lsquo;right&rsquo; moves.</p>

<p>It sometimes helps when I write things out visually, so to represent this to myself I wrote out the example 2x2 grid paths as binary: 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100.</p>

<p>Only then did I FINALLY, embarrassingly realize what this problem was: really basic combinatorics.  Here&rsquo;s how I broke down the problem: given an nxn grid, what it&rsquo;s really asking is how many ways you can arrange n/2 1s and n/2 0s along a string of length n.  Since, however, these 0s and 1s are indistinguishable, the answer ends up being &lsquo;n choose n/2&rsquo;, or:</p>

<pre><code>  n!
------
2(n/2)!
</code></pre>

<p>The only real programming I did for this one was calculating those factorials, which in python (or any language) is pretty trivial.  Problem 15 down.</p>

<p>I biked downtown today.  It was cold.  Like, -13° windchill cold.  I needed some exercise, though, to work off this cold I&rsquo;ve had.  It was worth it just to see her smile.</p>

<p>I realized earlier that I&rsquo;d never chronicled my experience with Dropquest 2011.  For right now I&rsquo;ll just say it was incredibly fun and rewarding; I live for that kind of thing.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll expound a bit more later.  Until then.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s in the news &hellip;?</p>

<p>Off the top of my mind, this: <a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/">LINK</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I thought I was a patient person; I let programs run, pages load: I give them their time.  But to surrender control of both my mouse and keyboard for two minutes made me reconsider just how impatient I really am at my desk.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this as my solution to problem 12 on Project Euler chugs away, eating my resources.  It&rsquo;s a very, VERY brute-force solution, mind you.  The actual question can be found <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=12">here</a>.  It seems fairly straightforward; find the first triangle number with >500 factors.  I wrote a method to calculate the nth triangle number, and then wrote a brute-force &lsquo;factor counter&rsquo;, which just goes through every number smaller than the given input and sees if it divides it cleanly.  So that&rsquo;s running.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, I started looking up smarter solutions, of which this time there thankfully are.  There&rsquo;s a much easier way to calculate the number of factors a number has, based off its prime factors (I&rsquo;ll leave you to google it if you&rsquo;re interested).  So, once I write a &lsquo;prime-factorizer&rsquo; I should have a much better solution.</p>

<p>This work with Ruby and Python has given me more than an academic reason to learn more about functional programming.  I watched a few really great FP talks by Rich Hickey that got me interested, but learning the basics was as far as that had got me.  While there&rsquo;s still not a pressing need to really involve myself, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to slowly add bits and pieces to my repertoire as I need/research/find them.</p>

<p>EDIT(10:52pm)
So &hellip; while I was writing that post, I was realizing that my brute-force solution wasn&rsquo;t cutting it.  In fact, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t find the solution if I left it overnight, as it was taking exponentially longer with each new number (I was aware of this problem).</p>

<p>So, I went back, did a little research, and wrote a program that counts factors based on the number&rsquo;s prime factors.  It found the solution in under 1s.  Problem 13 down.</p>

<p>Live and learn.  Goodnight.</p>

		<p>I know I just wrote that last post about the Ruby scraper, but I wanted to take a quick second to talk quickly about what else I&rsquo;ve been doing with my time.</p>

<p>Mostly, I&rsquo;ve been reading.  This summer I discovered/fell in love with David Foster Wallace, and have read 5 of his books since then.  I&rsquo;d been checking them out from the library, but asked for &lsquo;A Supposedly Fun Thing &hellip;&rsquo; for Christmas and will probably finish that tonight.</p>

<p>Since I returned from Kenosha I&rsquo;ve been riding my bike anywhere within reason when I need transportation.  I had gotten lazy in December and started driving everywhere, but I&rsquo;m back on the saddle and feel much better doing so.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got several things on my Kindle that I&rsquo;ve been slowly getting through.  The details aren&rsquo;t important, but topics include Ruby, Lisp, regex, Clojure, and a bunch of other things I&rsquo;m really interested (but severely lacking) in.</p>

		<p>Well.</p>

<p>I worked on that scraper for a bit tonight, and finally have something that I will actually use now.  You can check it out <a href="http://ry-land.com/dev/cl.html">HERE</a>.  A few notes about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did not go and learn the correct way to program in Ruby, as I claimed I would before finishing this.  Although I did learn some basic Ruby syntax in the work I&rsquo;ve done on this so far, I mostly grew impatient and decided to hack out a solution tonight.</li>
<li>No really, this is a hack.  I decided I wanted sorting so I quickly found a javascript table sorter and based my output around that code (which is most noticeable with the * before January postings [yay alphabetic sorting!]).

<ul>
<li>The date was particularly problematic, considering that the page I was parsing gave dates in a <code>%a %b %d</code> format (i.e. &lsquo;Thu Jan 10&rsquo;).  This meant I could either write my own code to figure out the year (which would still be a hack, and vary depending on the current date) or just hack it like I did (albeit temporarily)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relating to that last point, I was considering storing this data in a database. This would make sorting a simple matter of changing the query, but that kind of stuff is easy and wouldn&rsquo;t really help me or the page in any significant way; that&rsquo;s probably not going to happen.</li>
<li>The script as it stands is just writing an HTML file from its data.  While I could have had it do this in-place, I&rsquo;m actually storing the jobs individually as objects in an array, and then later writing them out.  This is obviously wasteful but again, at this scale who cares (as long as I&rsquo;m aware of it, right?).</li>
<li>I set up the script to run every half-hour during normal business hours.  I thought that was cool.</li>
</ul>

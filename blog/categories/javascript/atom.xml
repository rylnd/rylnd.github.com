    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I was doing some style work on the blog recently, and I remembered that no one will care how good the site looks if there&rsquo;s no content. I know I&rsquo;ve not posted in a while, as my main outlets have been either <a href="http://twitter.com/rylnd">twitter</a> or <a href="https://coderwall.com/rylnd">coderwall</a>, so please check those out if there&rsquo;s nothing new here. Links are at the bottom, as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>I installed the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/tlvince/leanpress">leanpress</a> theme for this site, which as you&rsquo;ll remember is run on Octopress. I had to make a few customizations (mostly to fix up some gross old posts), but I&rsquo;m really loving its minimalism and emphasis on readability.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m getting familiar enough with design that I&rsquo;ve reached a refinement phase, where the emphasis shifts from learning <em>how</em> to do something to learning <em>when</em> to do it. I no longer want a blog that&rsquo;s technologically impressive, I want one that people can read.</p>

<p>At almost two years into my career in web development, the most useful skill I&rsquo;ve acquired, without a doubt, is git. The concepts of source control combined with the power and prevalence of git make for a near-universally marketable skill. I love it and have a lot of thoughts on the topic, but I&rsquo;m saving them for another blog post.</p>

<p>At the beginning of my career, I didn&rsquo;t even know enough to recognize that big source-control-sized hole in my skillset. What was glaringly obvious, though, was that I didn&rsquo;t know javascript. However, since November I&rsquo;ve been working on an impressively large Backbone.js project with a team of awesome developers. Needless to say, I feel like I&rsquo;ve climbed that mountain as well. At the very least, I know what I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel confident in saying that I &lsquo;get&rsquo; javascript, now.</p>

<p>Of course, I owe it all to <a href="http://bendyworks.com">Bendyworks</a>. They saw my potential and enthusiasm, and gave me a strong foundation and the freedom to seek out my passions. In return, I&rsquo;ve done my best to help grow Bendyworks into the finest company that I can imagine.</p>

    <id>http://rylnd.github.com/blog/2011/05/09/my-first-hackathon-play-by-play</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into a former coworker at Noodles last week, and when I mentioned I was moving to Milwaukee and looking for a job, he suggested I take a look at <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a>, a startup incubator based in Milwaukee.  I did some research and found that they were putting on a 24-hour hackathon over the weekend!  Realizing that this event combined three things I desperately needed: hacking experience, job opportunities (or at least some MKE networking), and free food, I decided I simply couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>

<p>This all happened on Thursday evening, with the event starting Saturday at noon. Sure it was short notice, but all coding was to be done on-site, right?  All we needed by Saturday was an idea.  While I had managed to convince a couple friends (Jared and Devin) to join my &lsquo;team&rsquo; on Friday evening, we still didn&rsquo;t have an idea.  There was some mention of the Zappos API, but the team&rsquo;s general indolence brought us to our final idea:  winging it.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, 12:00pm:</strong>  I felt a bit nervous walking in, as I&rsquo;d never done any public coding before. All the more reason to start now though, right?  People slowly trickled in.  12:30pm: Time to announce our plans to everyone.  Uh oh.  We&rsquo;d forgot about that.  We figured a plan would slowly form as we tinkered with the tools we were given; actually presenting that was going to be embarrassing, as everyone else seemed to have a solid game plan.  But we did.  Something along the lines of &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to use the Zappos API.  That is all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, we had a team name and a git repo (Devin), both named Hot Biscuits (don&rsquo;t ask me).  An encryption bug on my laptop prevented me from authenticating with github until I finally figured out a workaround; speed bump #1.</p>

<p>We tinkered with the API for a bit, and while the documentation didn&rsquo;t exactly match what the API was sending us, we were able to figure it out pretty quick.  Jared got Apache running, Devin set up the DNS (and bought a new domain name, for funsies), and I got the initial databases up and running.  Not a bad start.</p>

<p>With a general structure in place, the next step was to start polling the API and storing the results.  Perl was suggested, as were ruby, clojure, and python.  I said I&rsquo;d do this part, in python (due to previous experience), and set to work.  Jared took off for a bit to run some errands, and Devin, left waiting on my work, started writing the API->DB in clojure, being the fanboy that he is.</p>

<p>The script wasn&rsquo;t as clean as I would have liked, because despite having a nice list of dicts to work with, I still had to quote the text being stored, and format the dates to appease the MySQL gods.  After a little bit, though, I had what looked like the correct sequence of SQL statements printing to stdout.  I changed the prints to executes, ran the script, and got &hellip; a whole bunch of encoding errors.  The problem involved some Unicode characters being sent back, and I figured I just had to specify UTF-8 as the encoding type and move right along.  Nope.  Not knowing about the default collation in MySQL, I suspected that might be the problem.  Nope.  Devin was still chugging away on his clojure implementation, and Jared, errands run, ended up writing a solution in perl that actually worked (eventually).  So by the afternoon we had three (mostly) working scripts that did exactly the same thing.  Efficiency!</p>

<p>With data now coming in, we realized the API made no guarantee about duplicates, so we made a few changes to uniques in the DB to prevent that from happening.  Confident that we could now slap a few data-visualization APIs on top of what we had and call it an MVP, we decided to break for dinner/loved ones.</p>

<p>We ended up meeting later that night for a bit to discuss the next morning&rsquo;s game plan.  We mocked up a page layout, and planned on meeting back at the hackathon at 8:30 the next day (3 hours is plenty of time to do an entire front-end, right?). I also whipped up a craptacular logo before bed.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday Morning:</strong>  I reluctantly woke up a little before 8.  I was excited to work on the front-end, sure, but there are few things I value more than sleep (probably because I get so little of it during the work week).  Arrived at the building, and was immediately thwarted by locked doors; claims that the building would open again at 8am overlooked the fact that the building was officially closed on Sundays. I didn&rsquo;t have the number for the room the event was using, but one of the coordinators fortuitously came down a few minutes later to let someone else in.  Phew.</p>

<p>I figured (correctly) that my teammates would be late, so set to work on writing an HTML skeleton and a basic stylesheet.  Tinkered for a little bit with color schemes and <a href="http://www.patternify.com/">Patternify</a>, an awesome CSS pattern generator that gives you the tile image&rsquo;s base64 encoding, so you don&rsquo;t even need a separate image file (pretty sweet, right? I even used it for the blog&rsquo;s current bg).</p>

<p>Once my teammates showed up, the next few hours were a frantic, stressed blur.  We had location data, and we had brand data.  Someone whispered &ldquo;Crocs.&rdquo;  There it was: use our data to display statistics about Crocs purchases from Zappos.com.  A guaranteed winner; a tool everyone needed (they just didn&rsquo;t know it yet).</p>

<p>The night before, I&rsquo;d found a Google Charts API that could color a map.  It promised it could do so given a value for each region, and a &lsquo;color gradient.&rsquo;  &lsquo;Awesome,&rsquo; I naively thought.  &lsquo;I can give it #purchases in each state, and two colors, and it&rsquo;ll color the states along that gradient, similar to the tagroll on delicious.&rsquo;  Not so.  After a little more digging, turns out what they&rsquo;d meant by &lsquo;gradient&rsquo; was &lsquo;a list of hex colors, one for each region you specify you want colored.&rsquo;  Hmm.  Not quite as nice as I&rsquo;d envisioned, but I could still make it work; I just had to discretize the colors and the groups of states corresponding to them.  I took the simplest route; 48 states, a gradient of 6 colors, and 8 states for each color.  There&rsquo;d have been more contrast (probably) on the map had I factored the range of values(#crocs orders) into the algorithm, but after adding another DB to track purchases by state, and a few more corresponding lines to the perl script, with about an hour left I was more worried about other aspects of the project.</p>

<p>While I got the map working, Devin and Jared worked on styling, layout, and other content.  Devin, much more well-versed in modern web development tools than Jared or I, added HTML Boilerplate and picked a font.  Lacking the &lsquo;what&rsquo; or &lsquo;why&rsquo; of Boilerplate, Jared and I left Devin to &lsquo;do his thing.&rsquo;  Statistics from the DB were promptly pulled and displayed on the page (our only real content).</p>

<p>Reaching &lsquo;crunch time,&rsquo; and all three of us simultaneously making changes to the repo, it was git&rsquo;s time to shine.  While Jared and I were new to git, both svn users in the past (Aside:  UW-CS is so focused on theory that I didn&rsquo;t hear the word &lsquo;version control&rsquo; until my 2nd year.  None of my professors ever made any mention of development tools, save one fierce proponent of Emacs; I guess such knowledge is either assumed or ignored with a passing &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll figure it out later&rsquo;), we still quickly realized that our setup was the definition of &lsquo;wrong:&rsquo; we had no push/pull triggers, and the &lsquo;live&rsquo; copy of the repo was simply one Jared had cloned into the document root.  Subsequently, for any changes we pushed, we had to say &lsquo;Jared, please do a pull on the server copy.&rsquo; Not ideal, and frankly embarrassing to admit, but it&rsquo;s prompted me to learn how to properly use git, and is probably a bit humorous to those not directly involved.</p>

<p>We discussed making a javascript counter to keep track of time passed since our &lsquo;Croc Epoch,&rsquo; and agreed it would be super simple and wouldn&rsquo;t even need a query; we&rsquo;d just plug the time into the code itself.  Despite this, we still didn&rsquo;t have time to implement it, and so ended up with a (much less impressive) static time field.</p>

<p>That was it.  A few quick CSS3 features (lipstick on a corpse?) and it was noon.  Time for the presentations.</p>

<p>We were told to keep them to around 3-5 minutes, and while we were worried about actually having enough material, other groups certainly didn&rsquo;t have that problem; several went on for 15 or 20 minutes.  At this point we realized what we were up against:  most of the attendees were the business end of a startup, and were simply presenting ideas and mockups in the hopes of being funded.</p>

<p>So only a few groups had actually written most of their code in the past 24 hours; I think we may have been the only &lsquo;from scratch&rsquo; team.  The vast majority, it seemed, were months into their projects, idea-wise if not code-wise.  Needless to say, our presentation of &lsquo;here&rsquo;s what we did in a few hours, on a whim&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t exactly wow the judges, especially when compared to &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s this well-thought-out startup idea that, while not actually implemented yet, is still really cool and useful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Needless to say, we didn&rsquo;t win anything.  Though Spreenkler had been given three $500 Zappos.com gift cards, and we were one of three teams to have used their API, we did not receive a gift card.  Not that I blame Spreenkler; I understand their decision; they couldn&rsquo;t expect to award anything to an obviously impromptu entry without hearing endless frustrated complaints from the other entrants.  Still, I could&rsquo;ve used some new shoes, and I do feel that we did more &lsquo;hacking&rsquo; at the event than most, if not all other teams.</p>

<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m not sure how to feel about the experience.  I&rsquo;m happy that I went, as I learned some new tricks, got to hang out with friends and enjoyed some free food.  At the same time, I worry about the reception of our efforts.</p>

<p>My final decision to enter the hackathon was based on the idea that a late entry was better than no entry at all.  It was also made under the assumption that this was a true build-something-in-24-hours event, which it certainly was not.  I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if these misunderstandings caused us not to be taken seriously, or, worse yet, for Spreenkler to take offense to our well-intentioned entry.</p>

<p>If the latter is true, though, then our entry certainly did more harm than good.  I&rsquo;d like to apologize to the Spreenkler team if that&rsquo;s the case.  If they were able to see past our hasty submission to our genuine talent, though, that&rsquo;s all I could have asked for.</p>

<p>P.S. I ended up implementing the aforementioned javascript counter a few days after the hackathon ended.  More for my peace of mind than anything else.  I ended up writing a short solution on my own, and then once it didn&rsquo;t work immediately as I&rsquo;d envisioned found a library someone else had written; I thought it was a good compromise.</p>

<p>And oh, yeah, here&rsquo;s the (final?) product: <a href="http://crocepoch.com">CROC EPOCH</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve posted anything.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy.</p>

<p>Between my new 9-5, an amazing girlfriend, the weather improving, several web projects and a few novels, my plate&rsquo;s been plenty full.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not gotten any new projects lately, but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of small(ish) changes/fixes to those I&rsquo;ve already got going.  I&rsquo;ve been considering having some kind of changelog for all my stuff in general, mostly to keep track of what I&rsquo;m doing on a day-to-day basis.  I&rsquo;ve started documenting such work but have yet to figure out a good place to share that with the rest of the world (or if that&rsquo;s even necessary).  I mean,<em> I</em> know I&rsquo;m doing the work, I just think it would be nice to let others know as well.</p>

<p>On that note, here&rsquo;s some general stuff I&rsquo;ve been working on since we last talked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added some stuff to lucy-dog.com, mostly aesthetic:

<ul>
<li>Changed title(s), metadata</li>
<li>Added a few new pictures</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting, paging issues with &lsquo;show all&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broken Spoke Updates:

<ul>
<li>Migrated existing site to new host</li>
<li>Added Events functionality to DB, front-end, admin panel</li>
<li>Added, tweaked some .js libraries for picking dates and times (related to Events)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all I can think of off the top of my head. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I get an actual changelog documented.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reminded this last week that GoDaddy is a real pain if you don&rsquo;t want to use their GUIs for everything.  Allowing SSH access took around 2 days to finally get implemented, after the DNS settings were populated.  I have yet to figure out how to use mysql from a shell; no combination of usernames and passwords allows me access, although those same credentials work everywhere else.  I&rsquo;m sure PHPMyAdmin is a fine tool if you like that sort of thing, but I really just want access to a mysql prompt.  Is that so much to ask, GoDaddy?</p>

<p>On a related rant I have yet to find a good emacs script for multi-mode editing (PHP, javascript, html, css in this example). I tried a few but they weren&rsquo;t really what I was looking for.  From what I remember (this was a few weeks back) one was very close, but its PHP-mode was all kinds of broken, to the point of unusability.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.</p>

<p>Almost done with the bike site, with the notable exception of graphics.  I am <em>absolutely</em> not a graphic designer, much as it pains me to admit.  I&rsquo;ve taken on a few projects now where they&rsquo;ve handed me a logo designed by someone for use as a sticker or on a t-shirt.  That&rsquo;s great, but my Adobe fu isn&rsquo;t such that I can easily make that into a pretty, well-laid-out header graphic.  Consequently graphics are what need the most improvement on these sites.  I&rsquo;m getting better with Photoshop and Illustrator every day, but at this point I&rsquo;d never take on a &lsquo;design&rsquo; project.  I truly appreciate nice graphics, and know what does and does not work or look good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I&rsquo;m not a graphic designer.  I write code.  It&rsquo;s one of those things where I think, &lsquo;With some experience you can make some awesome logos!&rsquo; and keep that in the back of my mind as I fumble with these design tools to produce graphics that don&rsquo;t quite cut it.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll eventually get there.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll just hire a graphic designer.</p>

<p>On a less technical note, I finished Infinite Jest a few weeks ago.  Initially I was upset by the ending (if one wants to call it that), but after a day or two of subconscious processing I came to the opposite conclusion: that while certain elements of the story were not explicitly explained, there were plenty of clues and allusions to allow the reader to work things out for himself.  I liked that.  Apparently DFW&rsquo;s last unfinished novel is out now, so I&rsquo;m going to have to pick that up soon.</p>

<p>At Devin&rsquo;s Mad Clojure Meetup last week I was referred to Logicomix, which I shortly thereafter bought and consumed.  The idea and format were what drew me immediately in:  a story about famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, in graphic novel format?  What&rsquo;s not to like about that?  While the illustrations were amazing, I found the writing a little boring and sometimes awkwardly/ambiguously phrased.  While I understand that including in-depth details of the fields would have made the book inaccessible to a good majority of readers, that&rsquo;s honestly what I was expecting and was a bit disappointed in that regard.  I felt that the book was too vague to be useful as anything more than a character-driven story and general history lesson.  Maybe that&rsquo;s what they were going for; I just imagined that they would cater to the &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; audience a bit more.</p>

<p>Still looking for a job in Milwaukee.  Further updates as events warrant.</p>

    <link href="http://rylnd.github.com/blog/2011/03/15/new-site-new-job/"/>
    <updated>2011-03-15T05:48:21-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://rylnd.github.com/blog/2011/03/15/new-site-new-job</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I last posted.  Quite a bit&rsquo;s happened in that time.</p>

<p>To begin, I finally found a job.  Starting Wednesday I&rsquo;ll be working a regular 9-to-5, doing primarily technical support for pharmacy software.  While it&rsquo;s only a temporary position and doesn&rsquo;t involve much development, I&rsquo;m still really looking forward to some structure and a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; circadian rhythm.  I consider myself one of those people that loves to work, and get genuine satisfaction from doing a job well.  Also, it&rsquo;s well-paying and I&rsquo;m dead broke; that certainly doesn&rsquo;t hamper my anticipation.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done any Project Euler since I reached Level 2.  I felt it was a good stopping point for the time being, but I&rsquo;ve definitely learned a lot from it and plan on doing a problem or two when the urge strikes; perhaps in a new language.  It&rsquo;s been really good for learning syntax and structure basics for Python, and at this point I feel confident that I could pretty easily solve most problems with it.  If you&rsquo;re looking to learn a new language, applications (in the literal sense) to math problems are in my opinion a great way to start.</p>

<p>Still working on a couple of web development contracts, both for starting businesses.  They&rsquo;re going well, although the biggest problem I&rsquo;m having is with the level of detail to which I&rsquo;m giving these sites.  I&rsquo;m trying to keep things quick and simple, but jQuery and PHP make doing all these awesome things so simple that I end up spending wayyy too much time experimenting with features the client neither asked for nor particularly needs.  Giving them more than they asked for up-front isn&rsquo;t really a problem in itself (deleting is pretty simple), but it&rsquo;s becoming one given that these need to get finished post-haste since time will be sparse come tomorrow.</p>

<p>Finally, I launched a site last week called (tentatively): <a href="http://lucy-dog.com">Lucy In Hats</a>.  It started out as a joking comment about my girlfriend&rsquo;s dog, and within a few hours I had bought a domain name and had something up and running.  I&rsquo;ve been making tweaks and adding features since then, but the concept&rsquo;s been the same since the start: people vote on pictures of an adorable mini-pug in silly hats.</p>

<p>I ended up going through with the idea because I wanted to see how much traffic I could generate to the site, under the general knowledge that people can&rsquo;t get enough of cute animals.  That and learning the underlying technologies needed for a relatively simple site like this were my main goals for the project. The fact I only had to spend $10 on a domain name got things off the ground right away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done some &lsquo;advertising&rsquo; on Facebook, both on my account and on the lady&rsquo;s; beyond that I&rsquo;ve been relying on word-of-mouth and people&rsquo;s attraction to cuteness.  I&rsquo;d say he site is a success even at this point, at least as compared to ry-land.com and this blog.</p>

<p>As of right now I&rsquo;ve had around 10x as many unique visitors to the site as to ry-land.com, and about 35x as many page views.  Granted, I haven&rsquo;t advertised ry-land.com on Facebook, nor is there dynamic content to drive all those page views, but I&rsquo;m still pretty impressed by its popularity in the first week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really cranking out the jQuery and PHP and doing new stuff with them every day.  I&rsquo;m enjoying it, learning a bunch, and tomorrow I should even start making some money again.  Not bad.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[No Job, More Euler]]></title>
    <link href="http://rylnd.github.com/blog/2011/02/05/no-job-more-euler/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-05T15:57:27-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://rylnd.github.com/blog/2011/02/05/no-job-more-euler</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Worked on problems <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=23">23</a> and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=35">35</a> tonight.  Problem 23 was pretty straightforward, especially in Python:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Define a function that finds the sum of a number&rsquo;s proper divisors</p></li>
<li><p> Create a list of all abundant numbers less than 28123</p></li>
<li><p> Create a <strong>set</strong> of sums resulting from the addition of each pair in the list described in 2.</p></li>
<li><p> Create a final set of numbers &lt; 28123 that are not in the set described in 3.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The answer is the sum of that last set. Easy enough, right?  I&rsquo;ve been using the built-in <code>set</code> structure from Python where it makes sense (where I don&rsquo;t want duplicates), although I&rsquo;ve been doing so under the assumption that their duplicate handling is better-implemented than anything I would write after-the-fact.  I imagine they&rsquo;re just doing some checks before actually appending, but I&rsquo;m curious to learn exactly how they&rsquo;re doing it, and if in fact I&rsquo;m using set correctly in these instances.  Remind me to look that up later.</p>

<p>Figured I&rsquo;d have 35 finished by the time I finished writing this, but my algorithm is apparently too naive, and requires something more than iterating through all primes under one million to find which are circular. Dang.  I&rsquo;ll keep working on it after this, and post about it when I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<p>Did a bit of work on the main site, mostly behind the scenes.  I actually designed a few logos today, as I plan on putting a banner/header at the top in place of my little &lsquo;random statement&rsquo; javascript thingy.  I&rsquo;m moving toward making the front page more like the border-rounded, background-gradiented, &lsquo;look at me I&rsquo;m a 2.0 designer&rsquo; designs you see everywhere these days.  Not because I agree with the aesthetic, but because I want to show that I can do that, too.</p>

<p>Super Bowl tomorrow.  I honestly haven&rsquo;t payed very much attention this season, but having the Packers in the running always reminds me of the great Holmgren era, and thus of my childhood.  It&rsquo;s always fun to watch a football game with friends, especially when I&rsquo;m actually invested in a team, so tomorrow should be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Still no job, but I&rsquo;m pretty much constantly in talks with recruiters.  The fact that in the past several months they&rsquo;ve not managed to find me a job indicates that maybe they&rsquo;re not the best way to go, but I remain confident in my competence and have no doubt that eventually someone else will recognize it as well.</p>

<p>In the meantime I&rsquo;ll be calculating circular primes and learning from my mistakes.</p>

<p>Edit (12:16am):
Finished problem 35.  Pretty embarrassed about that one.  I was trying to speed up the algorithm by reducing the list of primes over which it was iterating, but wasn&rsquo;t having much luck, until the daily facepalm:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Besides 2 and 5, circular primes' digits can only be 1,3,7, or 9.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The number of primes under one million? About 78k.  Those that also satisfy the above condition? 2500.</p>

<p>Problem 35 down.  33 problems done, 289 to go.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve posted anything.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy.</p>

<p>Between my new 9-5, an amazing girlfriend, the weather improving, several web projects and a few novels, my plate&rsquo;s been plenty full.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not gotten any new projects lately, but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of small(ish) changes/fixes to those I&rsquo;ve already got going.  I&rsquo;ve been considering having some kind of changelog for all my stuff in general, mostly to keep track of what I&rsquo;m doing on a day-to-day basis.  I&rsquo;ve started documenting such work but have yet to figure out a good place to share that with the rest of the world (or if that&rsquo;s even necessary).  I mean,<em> I</em> know I&rsquo;m doing the work, I just think it would be nice to let others know as well.</p>

<p>On that note, here&rsquo;s some general stuff I&rsquo;ve been working on since we last talked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added some stuff to lucy-dog.com, mostly aesthetic:

<ul>
<li>Changed title(s), metadata</li>
<li>Added a few new pictures</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting, paging issues with &lsquo;show all&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broken Spoke Updates:

<ul>
<li>Migrated existing site to new host</li>
<li>Added Events functionality to DB, front-end, admin panel</li>
<li>Added, tweaked some .js libraries for picking dates and times (related to Events)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all I can think of off the top of my head. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I get an actual changelog documented.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reminded this last week that GoDaddy is a real pain if you don&rsquo;t want to use their GUIs for everything.  Allowing SSH access took around 2 days to finally get implemented, after the DNS settings were populated.  I have yet to figure out how to use mysql from a shell; no combination of usernames and passwords allows me access, although those same credentials work everywhere else.  I&rsquo;m sure PHPMyAdmin is a fine tool if you like that sort of thing, but I really just want access to a mysql prompt.  Is that so much to ask, GoDaddy?</p>

<p>On a related rant I have yet to find a good emacs script for multi-mode editing (PHP, javascript, html, css in this example). I tried a few but they weren&rsquo;t really what I was looking for.  From what I remember (this was a few weeks back) one was very close, but its PHP-mode was all kinds of broken, to the point of unusability.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.</p>

<p>Almost done with the bike site, with the notable exception of graphics.  I am <em>absolutely</em> not a graphic designer, much as it pains me to admit.  I&rsquo;ve taken on a few projects now where they&rsquo;ve handed me a logo designed by someone for use as a sticker or on a t-shirt.  That&rsquo;s great, but my Adobe fu isn&rsquo;t such that I can easily make that into a pretty, well-laid-out header graphic.  Consequently graphics are what need the most improvement on these sites.  I&rsquo;m getting better with Photoshop and Illustrator every day, but at this point I&rsquo;d never take on a &lsquo;design&rsquo; project.  I truly appreciate nice graphics, and know what does and does not work or look good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I&rsquo;m not a graphic designer.  I write code.  It&rsquo;s one of those things where I think, &lsquo;With some experience you can make some awesome logos!&rsquo; and keep that in the back of my mind as I fumble with these design tools to produce graphics that don&rsquo;t quite cut it.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll eventually get there.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll just hire a graphic designer.</p>

<p>On a less technical note, I finished Infinite Jest a few weeks ago.  Initially I was upset by the ending (if one wants to call it that), but after a day or two of subconscious processing I came to the opposite conclusion: that while certain elements of the story were not explicitly explained, there were plenty of clues and allusions to allow the reader to work things out for himself.  I liked that.  Apparently DFW&rsquo;s last unfinished novel is out now, so I&rsquo;m going to have to pick that up soon.</p>

<p>At Devin&rsquo;s Mad Clojure Meetup last week I was referred to Logicomix, which I shortly thereafter bought and consumed.  The idea and format were what drew me immediately in:  a story about famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, in graphic novel format?  What&rsquo;s not to like about that?  While the illustrations were amazing, I found the writing a little boring and sometimes awkwardly/ambiguously phrased.  While I understand that including in-depth details of the fields would have made the book inaccessible to a good majority of readers, that&rsquo;s honestly what I was expecting and was a bit disappointed in that regard.  I felt that the book was too vague to be useful as anything more than a character-driven story and general history lesson.  Maybe that&rsquo;s what they were going for; I just imagined that they would cater to the &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; audience a bit more.</p>

<p>Still looking for a job in Milwaukee.  Further updates as events warrant.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I last posted.  Quite a bit&rsquo;s happened in that time.</p>

<p>To begin, I finally found a job.  Starting Wednesday I&rsquo;ll be working a regular 9-to-5, doing primarily technical support for pharmacy software.  While it&rsquo;s only a temporary position and doesn&rsquo;t involve much development, I&rsquo;m still really looking forward to some structure and a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; circadian rhythm.  I consider myself one of those people that loves to work, and get genuine satisfaction from doing a job well.  Also, it&rsquo;s well-paying and I&rsquo;m dead broke; that certainly doesn&rsquo;t hamper my anticipation.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done any Project Euler since I reached Level 2.  I felt it was a good stopping point for the time being, but I&rsquo;ve definitely learned a lot from it and plan on doing a problem or two when the urge strikes; perhaps in a new language.  It&rsquo;s been really good for learning syntax and structure basics for Python, and at this point I feel confident that I could pretty easily solve most problems with it.  If you&rsquo;re looking to learn a new language, applications (in the literal sense) to math problems are in my opinion a great way to start.</p>

<p>Still working on a couple of web development contracts, both for starting businesses.  They&rsquo;re going well, although the biggest problem I&rsquo;m having is with the level of detail to which I&rsquo;m giving these sites.  I&rsquo;m trying to keep things quick and simple, but jQuery and PHP make doing all these awesome things so simple that I end up spending wayyy too much time experimenting with features the client neither asked for nor particularly needs.  Giving them more than they asked for up-front isn&rsquo;t really a problem in itself (deleting is pretty simple), but it&rsquo;s becoming one given that these need to get finished post-haste since time will be sparse come tomorrow.</p>

<p>Finally, I launched a site last week called (tentatively): <a href="http://lucy-dog.com">Lucy In Hats</a>.  It started out as a joking comment about my girlfriend&rsquo;s dog, and within a few hours I had bought a domain name and had something up and running.  I&rsquo;ve been making tweaks and adding features since then, but the concept&rsquo;s been the same since the start: people vote on pictures of an adorable mini-pug in silly hats.</p>

<p>I ended up going through with the idea because I wanted to see how much traffic I could generate to the site, under the general knowledge that people can&rsquo;t get enough of cute animals.  That and learning the underlying technologies needed for a relatively simple site like this were my main goals for the project. The fact I only had to spend $10 on a domain name got things off the ground right away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done some &lsquo;advertising&rsquo; on Facebook, both on my account and on the lady&rsquo;s; beyond that I&rsquo;ve been relying on word-of-mouth and people&rsquo;s attraction to cuteness.  I&rsquo;d say he site is a success even at this point, at least as compared to ry-land.com and this blog.</p>

<p>As of right now I&rsquo;ve had around 10x as many unique visitors to the site as to ry-land.com, and about 35x as many page views.  Granted, I haven&rsquo;t advertised ry-land.com on Facebook, nor is there dynamic content to drive all those page views, but I&rsquo;m still pretty impressed by its popularity in the first week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really cranking out the jQuery and PHP and doing new stuff with them every day.  I&rsquo;m enjoying it, learning a bunch, and tomorrow I should even start making some money again.  Not bad.</p>

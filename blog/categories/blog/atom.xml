    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In case this wasn't apparent, I wanted to make it explicit real quickly:  all the blog posts thus far have been written on the fly.  I've not gone back and edited them in any major (or minor, for that matter) way;  I believe my stream-of-consciousness is coherent enough to follow without doing so, and I'm not trying to win any Pulitzers here anyway.</p>

<p>That being said, if something is unclear or obviously, distractingly wrong in one of my posts, please feel free to let me know and I'll definitely look into making it clearer/correct.</p>

<p>I realize also that this disclaimer will likely only be read by me, so it's probably more of a note to myself to be more conscious of those kinds of things while writing than an actual disclaimer to my (allegedly extant) readership.</p>

<p>Apparently the word of the day is 'extant.'</p>

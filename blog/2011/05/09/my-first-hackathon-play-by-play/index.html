<div class="entry-content"><p>I ran into a former coworker at Noodles last week, and when I mentioned I was moving to Milwaukee and looking for a job, he suggested I take a look at <a href="http://www.spreenkler.com/">Spreenkler</a>, a startup incubator based in Milwaukee.  I did some research and found that they were putting on a 24-hour hackathon over the weekend!  Realizing that this event combined three things I desperately needed: hacking experience, job opportunities (or at least some MKE networking), and free food, I decided I simply couldn&#8217;t pass it up.</p>

<p>This all happened on Thursday evening, with the event starting Saturday at noon. Sure it was short notice, but all coding was to be done on-site, right?  All we needed by Saturday was an idea.  While I had managed to convince a couple friends (Jared and Devin) to join my &#8216;team&#8217; on Friday evening, we still didn&#8217;t have an idea.  There was some mention of the Zappos API, but the team&#8217;s general indolence brought us to our final idea:  winging it.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, 12:00pm:</strong>  I felt a bit nervous walking in, as I&#8217;d never done any public coding before. All the more reason to start now though, right?  People slowly trickled in.  12:30pm: Time to announce our plans to everyone.  Uh oh.  We&#8217;d forgot about that.  We figured a plan would slowly form as we tinkered with the tools we were given; actually presenting that was going to be embarrassing, as everyone else seemed to have a solid game plan.  But we did.  Something along the lines of &#8216;We&#8217;re going to use the Zappos API.  That is all.&#8217;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, we had a team name and a git repo (Devin), both named Hot Biscuits (don&#8217;t ask me).  An encryption bug on my laptop prevented me from authenticating with github until I finally figured out a workaround; speed bump #1.</p>

<p>We tinkered with the API for a bit, and while the documentation didn&#8217;t exactly match what the API was sending us, we were able to figure it out pretty quick.  Jared got Apache running, Devin set up the DNS (and bought a new domain name, for funsies), and I got the initial databases up and running.  Not a bad start.</p>

<p>With a general structure in place, the next step was to start polling the API and storing the results.  Perl was suggested, as were ruby, clojure, and python.  I said I&#8217;d do this part, in python (due to previous experience), and set to work.  Jared took off for a bit to run some errands, and Devin, left waiting on my work, started writing the API->DB in clojure, being the fanboy that he is.</p>

<p>The script wasn&#8217;t as clean as I would have liked, because despite having a nice list of dicts to work with, I still had to quote the text being stored, and format the dates to appease the MySQL gods.  After a little bit, though, I had what looked like the correct sequence of SQL statements printing to stdout.  I changed the prints to executes, ran the script, and got &#8230; a whole bunch of encoding errors.  The problem involved some Unicode characters being sent back, and I figured I just had to specify UTF-8 as the encoding type and move right along.  Nope.  Not knowing about the default collation in MySQL, I suspected that might be the problem.  Nope.  Devin was still chugging away on his clojure implementation, and Jared, errands run, ended up writing a solution in perl that actually worked (eventually).  So by the afternoon we had three (mostly) working scripts that did exactly the same thing.  Efficiency!</p>

<p>With data now coming in, we realized the API made no guarantee about duplicates, so we made a few changes to uniques in the DB to prevent that from happening.  Confident that we could now slap a few data-visualization APIs on top of what we had and call it an MVP, we decided to break for dinner/loved ones.</p>

<p>We ended up meeting later that night for a bit to discuss the next morning&#8217;s game plan.  We mocked up a page layout, and planned on meeting back at the hackathon at 8:30 the next day (3 hours is plenty of time to do an entire front-end, right?). I also whipped up a craptacular logo before bed.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday Morning:</strong>  I reluctantly woke up a little before 8.  I was excited to work on the front-end, sure, but there are few things I value more than sleep (probably because I get so little of it during the work week).  Arrived at the building, and was immediately thwarted by locked doors; claims that the building would open again at 8am overlooked the fact that the building was officially closed on Sundays. I didn&#8217;t have the number for the room the event was using, but one of the coordinators fortuitously came down a few minutes later to let someone else in.  Phew.</p>

<p>I figured (correctly) that my teammates would be late, so set to work on writing an HTML skeleton and a basic stylesheet.  Tinkered for a little bit with color schemes and <a href="http://www.patternify.com/">Patternify</a>, an awesome CSS pattern generator that gives you the tile image&#8217;s base64 encoding, so you don&#8217;t even need a separate image file (pretty sweet, right? I even used it for the blog&#8217;s current bg).</p>

<p>Once my teammates showed up, the next few hours were a frantic, stressed blur.  We had location data, and we had brand data.  Someone whispered &#8220;Crocs.&#8221;  There it was: use our data to display statistics about Crocs purchases from Zappos.com.  A guaranteed winner; a tool everyone needed (they just didn&#8217;t know it yet).</p>

<p>The night before, I&#8217;d found a Google Charts API that could color a map.  It promised it could do so given a value for each region, and a &#8216;color gradient.&#8217;  &#8216;Awesome,&#8217; I naively thought.  &#8216;I can give it #purchases in each state, and two colors, and it&#8217;ll color the states along that gradient, similar to the tagroll on delicious.&#8217;  Not so.  After a little more digging, turns out what they&#8217;d meant by &#8216;gradient&#8217; was &#8216;a list of hex colors, one for each region you specify you want colored.&#8217;  Hmm.  Not quite as nice as I&#8217;d envisioned, but I could still make it work; I just had to discretize the colors and the groups of states corresponding to them.  I took the simplest route; 48 states, a gradient of 6 colors, and 8 states for each color.  There&#8217;d have been more contrast (probably) on the map had I factored the range of values(#crocs orders) into the algorithm, but after adding another DB to track purchases by state, and a few more corresponding lines to the perl script, with about an hour left I was more worried about other aspects of the project.</p>

<p>While I got the map working, Devin and Jared worked on styling, layout, and other content.  Devin, much more well-versed in modern web development tools than Jared or I, added HTML Boilerplate and picked a font.  Lacking the &#8216;what&#8217; or &#8216;why&#8217; of Boilerplate, Jared and I left Devin to &#8216;do his thing.&#8217;  Statistics from the DB were promptly pulled and displayed on the page (our only real content).</p>

<p>Reaching &#8216;crunch time,&#8217; and all three of us simultaneously making changes to the repo, it was git&#8217;s time to shine.  While Jared and I were new to git, both svn users in the past (Aside:  UW-CS is so focused on theory that I didn&#8217;t hear the word &#8216;version control&#8217; until my 2nd year.  None of my professors ever made any mention of development tools, save one fierce proponent of Emacs; I guess such knowledge is either assumed or ignored with a passing &#8216;they&#8217;ll figure it out later&#8217;), we still quickly realized that our setup was the definition of &#8216;wrong:&#8217; we had no push/pull triggers, and the &#8216;live&#8217; copy of the repo was simply one Jared had cloned into the document root.  Subsequently, for any changes we pushed, we had to say &#8216;Jared, please do a pull on the server copy.&#8217; Not ideal, and frankly embarrassing to admit, but it&#8217;s prompted me to learn how to properly use git, and is probably a bit humorous to those not directly involved.</p>

<p>We discussed making a javascript counter to keep track of time passed since our &#8216;Croc Epoch,&#8217; and agreed it would be super simple and wouldn&#8217;t even need a query; we&#8217;d just plug the time into the code itself.  Despite this, we still didn&#8217;t have time to implement it, and so ended up with a (much less impressive) static time field.</p>

<p>That was it.  A few quick CSS3 features (lipstick on a corpse?) and it was noon.  Time for the presentations.</p>

<p>We were told to keep them to around 3-5 minutes, and while we were worried about actually having enough material, other groups certainly didn&#8217;t have that problem; several went on for 15 or 20 minutes.  At this point we realized what we were up against:  most of the attendees were the business end of a startup, and were simply presenting ideas and mockups in the hopes of being funded.</p>

<p>So only a few groups had actually written most of their code in the past 24 hours; I think we may have been the only &#8216;from scratch&#8217; team.  The vast majority, it seemed, were months into their projects, idea-wise if not code-wise.  Needless to say, our presentation of &#8216;here&#8217;s what we did in a few hours, on a whim&#8217; didn&#8217;t exactly wow the judges, especially when compared to &#8216;Here&#8217;s this well-thought-out startup idea that, while not actually implemented yet, is still really cool and useful.&#8217;</p>

<p>Needless to say, we didn&#8217;t win anything.  Though Spreenkler had been given three $500 Zappos.com gift cards, and we were one of three teams to have used their API, we did not receive a gift card.  Not that I blame Spreenkler; I understand their decision; they couldn&#8217;t expect to award anything to an obviously impromptu entry without hearing endless frustrated complaints from the other entrants.  Still, I could&#8217;ve used some new shoes, and I do feel that we did more &#8216;hacking&#8217; at the event than most, if not all other teams.</p>

<p>In the end, I&#8217;m not sure how to feel about the experience.  I&#8217;m happy that I went, as I learned some new tricks, got to hang out with friends and enjoyed some free food.  At the same time, I worry about the reception of our efforts.</p>

<p>My final decision to enter the hackathon was based on the idea that a late entry was better than no entry at all.  It was also made under the assumption that this was a true build-something-in-24-hours event, which it certainly was not.  I can&#8217;t help but wonder if these misunderstandings caused us not to be taken seriously, or, worse yet, for Spreenkler to take offense to our well-intentioned entry.</p>

<p>If the latter is true, though, then our entry certainly did more harm than good.  I&#8217;d like to apologize to the Spreenkler team if that&#8217;s the case.  If they were able to see past our hasty submission to our genuine talent, though, that&#8217;s all I could have asked for.</p>

<p>P.S. I ended up implementing the aforementioned javascript counter a few days after the hackathon ended.  More for my peace of mind than anything else.  I ended up writing a short solution on my own, and then once it didn&#8217;t work immediately as I&#8217;d envisioned found a library someone else had written; I thought it was a good compromise.</p>

<p>And oh, yeah, here&#8217;s the (final?) product: <a href="http://crocepoch.com">CROC EPOCH</a></p>

        <p>What&#8217;s in the news &#8230;?</p>

<p>Off the top of my mind, this: <a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/">LINK</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I thought I was a patient person; I let programs run, pages load: I give them their time.  But to surrender control of both my mouse and keyboard for two minutes made me reconsider just how impatient I really am at my desk.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this as my solution to problem 12 on Project Euler chugs away, eating my resources.  It&#8217;s a very, VERY brute-force solution, mind you.  The actual question can be found <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=12">here</a>.  It seems fairly straightforward; find the first triangle number with >500 factors.  I wrote a method to calculate the nth triangle number, and then wrote a brute-force &#8216;factor counter&#8217;, which just goes through every number smaller than the given input and sees if it divides it cleanly.  So that&#8217;s running.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, I started looking up smarter solutions, of which this time there thankfully are.  There&#8217;s a much easier way to calculate the number of factors a number has, based off its prime factors (I&#8217;ll leave you to google it if you&#8217;re interested).  So, once I write a &#8216;prime-factorizer&#8217; I should have a much better solution.</p>

<p>This work with Ruby and Python has given me more than an academic reason to learn more about functional programming.  I watched a few really great FP talks by Rich Hickey that got me interested, but learning the basics was as far as that had got me.  While there&#8217;s still not a pressing need to really involve myself, it&#8217;s nice to be able to slowly add bits and pieces to my repertoire as I need/research/find them.</p>

<p>EDIT(10:52pm)
So &#8230; while I was writing that post, I was realizing that my brute-force solution wasn&#8217;t cutting it.  In fact, it probably wouldn&#8217;t find the solution if I left it overnight, as it was taking exponentially longer with each new number (I was aware of this problem).</p>

<p>So, I went back, did a little research, and wrote a program that counts factors based on the number&#8217;s prime factors.  It found the solution in under 1s.  Problem 13 down.</p>

<p>Live and learn.  Goodnight.</p>

        <p>I know I just wrote that last post about the Ruby scraper, but I wanted to take a quick second to talk quickly about what else I&#8217;ve been doing with my time.</p>

<p>Mostly, I&#8217;ve been reading.  This summer I discovered/fell in love with David Foster Wallace, and have read 5 of his books since then.  I&#8217;d been checking them out from the library, but asked for &#8216;A Supposedly Fun Thing &#8230;&#8217; for Christmas and will probably finish that tonight.</p>

<p>Since I returned from Kenosha I&#8217;ve been riding my bike anywhere within reason when I need transportation.  I had gotten lazy in December and started driving everywhere, but I&#8217;m back on the saddle and feel much better doing so.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got several things on my Kindle that I&#8217;ve been slowly getting through.  The details aren&#8217;t important, but topics include Ruby, Lisp, regex, Clojure, and a bunch of other things I&#8217;m really interested (but severely lacking) in.</p>

        <p>Well.</p>

<p>I worked on that scraper for a bit tonight, and finally have something that I will actually use now.  You can check it out <a href="http://ry-land.com/dev/cl.html">HERE</a>.  A few notes about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did not go and learn the correct way to program in Ruby, as I claimed I would before finishing this.  Although I did learn some basic Ruby syntax in the work I&#8217;ve done on this so far, I mostly grew impatient and decided to hack out a solution tonight.</li>
<li>No really, this is a hack.  I decided I wanted sorting so I quickly found a javascript table sorter and based my output around that code (which is most noticeable with the * before January postings [yay alphabetic sorting!]).

<ul>
<li>The date was particularly problematic, considering that the page I was parsing gave dates in a <code>%a %b %d</code> format (i.e. &#8216;Thu Jan 10&#8217;).  This meant I could either write my own code to figure out the year (which would still be a hack, and vary depending on the current date) or just hack it like I did (albeit temporarily)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relating to that last point, I was considering storing this data in a database. This would make sorting a simple matter of changing the query, but that kind of stuff is easy and wouldn&#8217;t really help me or the page in any significant way; that&#8217;s probably not going to happen.</li>
<li>The script as it stands is just writing an HTML file from its data.  While I could have had it do this in-place, I&#8217;m actually storing the jobs individually as objects in an array, and then later writing them out.  This is obviously wasteful but again, at this scale who cares (as long as I&#8217;m aware of it, right?).</li>
<li>I set up the script to run every half-hour during normal business hours.  I thought that was cool.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>So I&#8217;ve been tinkering with Ruby/Rails, using Mechanize to try and whip up a quick scraper for craigslist to aid me in my job search.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not a novel or particularly interesting idea, but practice is practice, right?  I feel like I&#8217;m learning <em>something</em> and I&#8217;m definitely not comfortable with the language, so that&#8217;s good, right?</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier how I was impressed with how easily I was able to retrieve an array of link objects from a given page (seriously, 2 lines).  That still stands.  It seems that craigslist is particularly difficult for this kind of task, or at least this particular tool (in how I&#8217;ve come to know it in these past few hours).  The problem is that craigslist&#8217;s DOM &#8216;tree&#8217; has lots of leaves.  These leaves are the data that I want.  So instead of using Mechanize&#8217;s neat features, I&#8217;m stuck basically just iterating through these leaves finding what I want.</p>

<p>That probably doesn&#8217;t make sense.  The point is, I need to learn more about all this before I actually try to write something.  In two hours I managed to write what&#8217;s basically just a compilation of several craigslist pages, and it works, but I know that this was a very, very naive approach.  I wrote a similar tool in Java over the summer for a job interview, and as it stands I&#8217;m not really using anything novel in the Ruby version (yet!).</p>

<p>The page is up on my site, but I&#8217;m not going to provide a link right now.  If you really cared (which you shouldn&#8217;t) you could probably find it.</p>

<p>This blog seems to have taken a somewhat negative turn as of the past few posts, so I wanted to say something about that:</p>

<blockquote><p>The point of this blog is to chronicle my technical projects, my personal life, and my job search.  What may be thought of as negative is generally the more interesting topic, for me at least.  I was discussing the shortcomings of this Ruby project not because I dislike Ruby but because I find it to be more helpful/thought-provoking than writing about some small success in said project.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think I&#8217;m done for the night.  Tomorrow&#8217;s goal: learn Ruby!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>So it&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve posted anything.  I&#8217;ve been pretty busy.</p>

<p>Between my new 9-5, an amazing girlfriend, the weather improving, several web projects and a few novels, my plate&#8217;s been plenty full.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not gotten any new projects lately, but I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of small(ish) changes/fixes to those I&#8217;ve already got going.  I&#8217;ve been considering having some kind of changelog for all my stuff in general, mostly to keep track of what I&#8217;m doing on a day-to-day basis.  I&#8217;ve started documenting such work but have yet to figure out a good place to share that with the rest of the world (or if that&#8217;s even necessary).  I mean,<em> I</em> know I&#8217;m doing the work, I just think it would be nice to let others know as well.</p>

<p>On that note, here&#8217;s some general stuff I&#8217;ve been working on since we last talked:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Added some stuff to lucy-dog.com, mostly aesthetic:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Changed title(s), metadata</p></li>
<li><p>Added a few new pictures</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed some formatting, paging issues with &#8216;show all&#8217;</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Broken Spoke Updates:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Migrated existing site to new host</p></li>
<li><p>Added Events functionality to DB, front-end, admin panel</p></li>
<li><p>Added, tweaked some .js libraries for picking dates and times (related to Events)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s all I can think of off the top of my head. I&#8217;ll let you know when I get an actual changelog documented.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reminded this last week that GoDaddy is a real pain if you don&#8217;t want to use their GUIs for everything.  Allowing SSH access took around 2 days to finally get implemented, after the DNS settings were populated.  I have yet to figure out how to use mysql from a shell; no combination of usernames and passwords allows me access, although those same credentials work everywhere else.  I&#8217;m sure PHPMyAdmin is a fine tool if you like that sort of thing, but I really just want access to a mysql prompt.  Is that so much to ask, GoDaddy?</p>

<p>On a related rant I have yet to find a good emacs script for multi-mode editing (PHP, javascript, html, css in this example). I tried a few but they weren&#8217;t really what I was looking for.  From what I remember (this was a few weeks back) one was very close, but its PHP-mode was all kinds of broken, to the point of unusability.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.</p>

<p>Almost done with the bike site, with the notable exception of graphics.  I am <em>absolutely</em> not a graphic designer, much as it pains me to admit.  I&#8217;ve taken on a few projects now where they&#8217;ve handed me a logo designed by someone for use as a sticker or on a t-shirt.  That&#8217;s great, but my Adobe fu isn&#8217;t such that I can easily make that into a pretty, well-laid-out header graphic.  Consequently graphics are what need the most improvement on these sites.  I&#8217;m getting better with Photoshop and Illustrator every day, but at this point I&#8217;d never take on a &#8216;design&#8217; project.  I truly appreciate nice graphics, and know what does and does not work or look good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I&#8217;m not a graphic designer.  I write code.  It&#8217;s one of those things where I think, &#8216;With some experience you can make some awesome logos!&#8217; and keep that in the back of my mind as I fumble with these design tools to produce graphics that don&#8217;t quite cut it.  Maybe I&#8217;ll eventually get there.  Maybe I&#8217;ll just hire a graphic designer.</p>

<p>On a less technical note, I finished Infinite Jest a few weeks ago.  Initially I was upset by the ending (if one wants to call it that), but after a day or two of subconscious processing I came to the opposite conclusion: that while certain elements of the story were not explicitly explained, there were plenty of clues and allusions to allow the reader to work things out for himself.  I liked that.  Apparently DFW&#8217;s last unfinished novel is out now, so I&#8217;m going to have to pick that up soon.</p>

<p>At Devin&#8217;s Mad Clojure Meetup last week I was referred to Logicomix, which I shortly thereafter bought and consumed.  The idea and format were what drew me immediately in:  a story about famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, in graphic novel format?  What&#8217;s not to like about that?  While the illustrations were amazing, I found the writing a little boring and sometimes awkwardly/ambiguously phrased.  While I understand that including in-depth details of the fields would have made the book inaccessible to a good majority of readers, that&#8217;s honestly what I was expecting and was a bit disappointed in that regard.  I felt that the book was too vague to be useful as anything more than a character-driven story and general history lesson.  Maybe that&#8217;s what they were going for; I just imagined that they would cater to the &#8216;nerd&#8217; audience a bit more.</p>

<p>Still looking for a job in Milwaukee.  Further updates as events warrant.</p>

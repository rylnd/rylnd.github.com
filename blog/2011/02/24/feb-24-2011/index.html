<div class="entry-content"><p>Haven&#8217;t written in a while.  Things have been busy.  Not always productive, but always busy.  I just finished a few PE problems, and I&#8217;ll talk about those in a bit, but first here&#8217;s everything else:</p>

<p>Officially started work on a new web development project, using mostly MySQL, JavaScript and PHP.  This will definitely be the most complicated of the ones I&#8217;ve done so far, so I&#8217;m looking forward to learning how to use these technologies to do things I&#8217;ve done in the past with .NET.  I&#8217;ll keep you posted on that.</p>

<p>The site&#8217;s in an awkward in-between phase right now;  I stripped down a lot of stuff in my towards-2.0 efforts, but haven&#8217;t added much new stuff besides some sweet fonts (props to @font-face).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been struggling lately with my genetic predisposition toward a veritable smorgasbord of allergies and their physical manifestations (thanks mom and dad!), trying to keep things under control with medication and allergen-avoidance, the latter of which unfortunately includes my girlfriend&#8217;s house.  So that&#8217;s no fun.  Things are getting much better though and I for one cannot wait for this cold, dry weather to end.</p>

<p>For the aforementioned and other reasons, I haven&#8217;t been doing a lot of going out.  Went to the Comedy Club last week for the 2nd round of the competition, but this week opted instead to see Say Hi at the High Noon Saloon, which was a good time.  Other than that it&#8217;s been interviews, doctor&#8217;s appointments, endless email correspondence, coding and reading.</p>

<p>I started Infinite Jest a few weeks ago and I&#8217;m a little more than 1/3 done right now.  Despite the fact that a friend owns a copy and lent it out to me, I (after much internal debate) opted to buy the electronic version for my Kindle, which I don&#8217;t regret.  Besides being able to jump to one of the hundreds of endnotes by simply clicking on the text-embedded link (as opposed to flipping rather awkwardly back and forth through a ragged, floppy paperback version), I&#8217;m also able to see the definition of a word (e.g. &#8216;atavistic&#8217;) simply by hovering over it.  I&#8217;m really enjoying both the book itself and its positive impact on my vocabulary.</p>

<p>Regarding the job front, all&#8217;s (mostly) quiet.  It&#8217;s still an awkward situation, between looking for temporary/contract/short-term work in Madison v. a development &#8216;career&#8217; in Milwaukee.  Even the contract jobs I&#8217;m finding here are confusingly looking for someone with the desire to work (the contract position) full-time.  While I haven&#8217;t been dishonest at interviews to any degree regarding my long-term goals and career plans, I know that doing so would probably get me the position (a few places have even stated this implicitly).  In a manner consistent with my vocational luck as of late, I&#8217;ve now been presented with one verifiable and one probable job offer, for long-term development positions here in Madison.  Again, though, I don&#8217;t want to lie my way into a job when I know very well I&#8217;ll be gone in August, so for the time being unemployed I remain.</p>

<p>Project Euler.  I&#8217;ve now got 43 problems done.  7 more and I&#8217;ll be level 2 and finished with the first page.  Regarding the last post I managed to speed up problem 27 and knocked that one down.  Tonight I completed <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=31">31</a>, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=37">37</a> and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=39">39</a>, but I&#8217;m mostly gonna be explaining and (<em>gasp</em>) presenting my solution to problem 39.</p>

<p>I had actually started on problem 37 a week or so ago, but my solution wasn&#8217;t finding all 11 requested primes in the range of like [1, 100,000,000].  I was on the right track with realizations like &#8216;these primes can&#8217;t contain the digits 4,6, or 8 anywhere,&#8217; I went wrong in also including 2 and 5 in that list, since those numbers could in fact be the leftmost digit of said primes.  P37 done.</p>

<p>Problem 31 was mostly a no-brainer; I&#8217;ve seen similar problems in Combinatorics and wrote a recursive algorithm to solve it.  It essentially involved moving from the highest-denomination coins to the lowest, with the recursive function calculating in how many ways the given amount could be made with a decreasing number of denominations.  P31 done.</p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=39">Problem 39</a> asks you to find the perimeter <em>p</em> of a right triangle that has the greatest number of possible pythagorean triples (a,b,c) that can satisfy that perimeter.  After some half-written solutions and great deliberation, the solution came out of knowing that term, &#8216;pythagorean triple,&#8217; and consequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple">this Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>Reading through this, particularly the parts about <strong>P</strong>rimitive <strong>P</strong>ythagorean <strong>T</strong>riples and Euclid&#8217;s formula, I was able to engineer a solution through the following logic:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All possible Pythagorean triples (what we&#8217;re trying to tally for our solution) are either a PPT or a multiple of same.</p></li>
<li><p>PPTs can be calculated with Euclid&#8217;s formula: <code>a = m^2 - n^2, b = 2mn, c = m^2 + n^2</code> given that <code>m &gt; n</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are coprime (i.e. <code>gcd(m,n)==1</code>), and one of them is even.</p></li>
<li><p>Combining the formula above with the Pythagorean Theorem and the obvious fact that <code>a + b + c = p</code>, we get: <code>2m^2 + 2mn = p</code></p></li>
<li><p>For a triple to be a solution for a perimeter <em>p</em>, <em>p</em> must be a multiple of a given PPT&#8217;s perimeter.  Put another way, for (a,b,c) of a satisfying PPT, <code>p % (a + b + c) == 0</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>After that it was just a matter of putting it all together:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2019433.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>from fractions import gcd

#Euclid's Formula
def getabc(m,n):
    a = m**2 - n**2
    b = 2*m*n
    c = m**2 + n**2
    return a,b,c

#calculate all PPTs for which p &lt; 1000
prim_trips = [getabc(m,n) for m in range(1,100) for n in range(1,100) if m &gt; n and gcd(m,n) == 1 and 2*m*m + 2*m*n &lt;= 1000 and (m%2 == 0 or n % 2 == 0)]

#find all possible triples for a given p
def total(p):
    return sum([1 for (a,b,c) in prim_trips if p % (a + b + c) == 0])

#collect all possible solutions for each perimeter p
totals = [(p,total(p)) for p in range(1,1001)]

#get max
print max(totals, key = lambda x: x[1] )
</code></pre></noscript></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hoo boy.  A lot has changed in the past few weeks.  After spending about a month looking for jobs and apartments in Milwaukee, we finally found both.  We found the perfect apartment, and I accepted a job offer for an awesome Django startup in Spreenkler's Accelerator program.  The day after I said yes to the job, I was approached with an offer here in Madison.  While both were amazing jobs, I ended up taking the job here in Madison as I felt it had more to offer, experientially.  Starting at the end of August, I'll be an official <a href="http://bendyworks.com/">Bendyworker</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this means that the time Amanda and I spent planning for Milwaukee was basically for naught.  I've got an amazing job, but we're back to square one apartment-wise.  I've moved every year since 2005; I'm ready to buy a house out of sheer laziness.</p>

<p>Speaking of laziness, I've been working day and night on our startup, <a href="http://jungolhq.com">Jungol</a>.  We just launched our alpha tonight, after much internal tinkering.  I've read time and again that the best thing you can do is just put your project out there, so it's something of a relief to finally have done so.  Check it out at <a href="http://jng.li/qJ338J">http://jng.li/qJ338J</a>.</p>

<p>There's a lot of smaller things that still need to be done, but most everything's there right now.  We've got our proof of concept; the rest is up to the public (who told us they wanted this, we swear).  It's an exciting time and I'm proud to be a part of the whole thing.  Having written the entire site save for design, it's becoming like a child to me, but I'm trying my best not to become too emotionally attached.</p>

<p>Our final frisbee game is next Tuesday.   Our <em>championship</em> frisbee game, that is.  This last week was playoffs, and we won both games.  I'm pretty proud of the team; we had a lot of beginners, some who'd never even played a team sport before, but we've come together and are playing amazingly well.  Playing with the same team every year is comforting, I'm sure, but there's something to be said for this amazing transition from 'group of people' to 'team' over the course of a season.  Remind me to let you know if we won or not.</p>

<p>So I've got a great job and a great girlfriend.  Let me know if you see any great apartments for rent around town.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh, hey there!  It's been so long I almost didn't recognize you!  Yeah, I've been good.  Real busy with work, if you can call it 'work.'  Busy regardless, though.</p>

<p>The Jungol project has been going great.   I don't think I can overemphasize how refreshing it is.  The team, the framework, the project itself, and the freedom that I'm given are amazing.  Don't think I'm not grateful.</p>

<p>We had a bit of an uphill climb at first, make no mistake.  We needed to take the original idea, gather a whole lot of customer feedback, and decide what was most likely to succeed given those inputs.  This brings to mind an excellent quote I saw on Twitter the other day:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Entrepreneurship is like jumping off a cliff and assembling your airplane on the way down"
-- Reid Hoffman</p></blockquote>

<p>I've got the plane's body and most of its engine done.  Now we get to start her up and start adding paint and decals.  I can't wait.</p>

<p>Ditching the metaphor and returning to reality, the lady and I will be heading to Milwaukee tomorrow to look at apartments.  It's going to be a welcome break from all the time spent staring at a terminal screen, but the overachiever in me is constantly nagging to 'get back to work.'  We might stay and go to Summerfest on Sunday, depending on how my Ego feels.</p>

<p>We attended our first Concert on the Square on Wednesday, which was graciously hosted by the folks at The Firm.  They have a balcony overlooking the capitol, and were even nice enough to fill their office with food, beer, developers, entrepreneurs, and investors!  It was a fun time, to say the least.</p>

<p>Frisbee has had its ups and downs; some games we dominate, others we barely avoid a forfeit due to lack of players.  We're not the best in the league, but we're certainly not the worst.  Win or lose, though, we still get two free pitchers after every game. :)</p>

<p>I don't really know what else to say right now.  Things are up in the air, and the future is uncertain, but I'm having a blast and learning every day.   I am happy.</p>
